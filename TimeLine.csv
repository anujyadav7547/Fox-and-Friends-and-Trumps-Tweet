>> i tell you  when you omit key facts to a document that is a summary of thousands and thousands of documents in itself he omissions can have grave consequences. i think all of us  every american sitting at home right now wants to have full transparency  not partial transparency anymore from anyone in washington and i'm talking republicans and democrats. any politician there are equally 	withholding information from the american public. if you take a document  four page summary i could give you a four page summary of the bible but i can omit john 3:16  god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life  jesus and i'm the way  the truth  the life  and other key  critical  completely deceived you of the truth and the only fact that matters that separates christianity from all the religions that jesus is god. that is dire consequences. doing the same thing with a memo of thousands and thousands of documents and paring it down to four pages can completely be misconstrued and have dire consequences. >> the fbi from what i understand  when they went to take a look at the fbi memo on 	sunday had 30 minutes and there were two or three other fbi members who took a look at it and they came out with this response and as of late last night a report there were changes made. whether those changes were made by republicans or the fbi out of their concern democrats are saying wait a minute  the memo has been changed. here is what devon nunez had to say in response to the statement. saying having stonewalled congress's demand for information for nearly a year no surprise the fbi and doj issue objections to allowing the american people to see information related to surveillance abuses of these agencies  do you think this is just another effort to stonewall? >> no. it is an effort  you pair down something to four pages and omit key facts you can make it say whatever you want to to say. you can do that and i think the fbi is saying when the american public doesn't have the full 	totality of all of the fact if we release a four page memo i'm all for that  let's also release the pfizer application  let's release the woods review file that goes with it that backs every factual assertion in the affidavit. let's release the contents of what the pfizer warrant is gleaning during the investigation  let's see the totality of everything and then the american public  you and me and the second balcony at the state of the union  americans who deserve to hear the truth can know everything. will that happen?

collides with a freight train in south carolina. this picture showing some of the train cars knocked off the track. the amtrak train heading from new york to miami derailing in d.c. that is just outside of columbia. happened 2:30 eastern time this morning. 139 passengers. eight crew members on board. the ntsb and red cross both headed to crash site. police will be holding a news conference this hour. and with that we welcome new to ""fox & friends"" on a sunday morning. ed  rachel  todd? rachel: nice to see you this morning. ed: disturbing news. rachel: obviously kind of a 	little touching for me i just got off that g.o.p. retreat where there was a train crash. what strikes you on the train is there is no seat belts. ed: thankfully most people were safe including you and your family but one person did died in that crash as well. rachel: 50 people injured and two dead. today. todd: these numbers. we have both been through this ed and obviously rachel was literally just in it when u. get these numbers early usually a harbinger of not good things going forward. ed: they have been telling us at least 25 people brought to a hospital there this n. south carolina. remind me a little bit of another major crash march 12th 20rbgs 15. amtrak 18 traveling here in the northeast corridor between new york and washington  d.c. remember  it was going twice the speed limit of 50 miles per hour. hit a curve around philly. 8 people were killed then. more than 200 injured. we haven't seen a tras crash ths 	large since then. two dead. 50 plus injured. when you get the numbers this early  suggests they are just going through the beginning phase of trying to figure out exactly -- rachel: weed should herewe shoue at 6:30 in the press conference. todd: collided with a csx train you have seen them. think are a major provider of freight services throughout our nation. i'm not diminish mizeing. >> not at all. >> a truck of some sort. this is another freight train  freight trains are big and obviously carry freight which means they have a lot of freight behind them colliding with an amtrak train and does beg the question. i know this is early at 6:02 on a sunday. why? happening? train service has been around since the 1800s. you have think we would have figured it out by now. rachel: goes a little faster 	tfaster. todd: true. rachel: going from new york to miami and this happening in casey  south carolina. ed: red cross. i was checking with the nbc national safety board twitter page and they have not updated anything. breaking as we speak. the last thing they tweeted about was the super bowl and getting somewhere safely to either get to the game or watch it at a friend's house. this is something now that has obviously gotten them into an urgent situation. an emergency situation there are at least 25 people who have been transported to a hospital there in the area of columbia  south carolina  called case. as you mentioned. in the area of columbia where people might know it as you are mentioning a freight train hitting a passenger train is just an awful  awful situation. todd: multiple hospitals being utilize utilize at this pt in that columbia  south carolina area. is that true major city in 	and around case  south carolina. from what we know lead engine did derail as well as some passenger cars. you have to keep that in mind. that implies to me a head on collision. rachel: this happening at around 2:30 this morning. todd: we are just getting these details as you are as well. for those who have been to columbia  south carolina. it is a major city there in south carolina. it does have a university there. so presumably does have a very good hospital as well. again  the injured are being taken to at least two local hospitals in that columbia  south carolina area. again  the train collision did happen in case  south carolina. ed: let me just say i mentioned the ntsb main twitter page not updated. second one i see news room. public relations team now telling us they tweeted this at 5:45 a.m. eastern time ntsb go team launching to investigate today's collision of an amtrak train and csx freight train near 	case  south carolina it updates a lot of the information we have already had. it does show you they are sending a go team. the ntsb trying to get on top of this as quickly as possible. rachel: media briefing 6:25 p.m. about 20 minutes from now. there is a shelter open for passengers. those weren't injured but need a place. todd: 8 crew members on board. for those of you worried about loved ones  this is amtrak train 91. it was traveling from new york to miami. presumably a lot of people are going to be affected by. this that's a pretty wide swath of the country. that's the east coast. ed: told 139 passengers  8 crew members. got to remember the crew members as well. had you mentioned  i think  todd at the beginning that the lead car had derailed. so whoever is in there is somebody obviously being attended to right now or multiple people. and there are obviously fears that these numbers are going to keep climbing. 	rachel: i know from the situation i was in this week that was the fear derailing. derailing is when you have a lot more injuries. todd: i don't mean to keep going back to this experience. but  you know  when it happened to you this week  what's going through your mind at that point in time? rachel: the sound. there is such a powerful sound. and you can imagine as you mentioned we had a garbage truck. this is a freight train. i can't imagine the sound that they are hearing  that they heard  just the confusion. people running up and down the aisles to check and see who else might be injured  what happened. you know  this happened at 2: 30 in the morning. you have to presume some people were probably sleeping. todd: unlike on your train where people are up. rachel: really jolted probably sleeping. very scary situation here. ed: we just learned that a shelter has been put together at pine ridge middle school. so if anybody is in the south carolina area  trying to get a handle on this where victims or passengers may be going  pine ridge middle school. 	we presume that's pretty close to where this crashed happened 2:30 a.m. eastern time. todd: right before christmas horrible timing for a train crash is bad but particularly before christmas. there was that dupont  washington that killed three people. and we saw there  i believe ed mention i had  the train was going 80 miles per hour when it derailed on a curve. speed limit only 30 miles per hour. it is way too early in this train crash to be presuming speed or what was a factor here. but what we do know is the lead car of this amtrak train collided with a csx freighter. as we have mentioned a few times here in the first seven minutes of our coverage. those are two very heavily weighted traveling forces. and  you know  it's almost fortunate and i don't want to  again  dominican mize what happened tdediminishdominid 	this week. train on train consequences can be deadly for presumably at this point people on board. rachel: again  happening at 2:30 in the morning. that means it's dark in the train. people are being jolted from their sleep  trying to find out what's going on. makes it harder when it's dark and cold outside. ed: now  we have got some numbers here and some details just to make sure to recap what we have been telling you. a statement coming in from amtrak. what they are saying is this amtrak train number 91. operating between new york and miami as we noted. came in contact with a csx freight train 2:35 a.m. iron time case  south carolina. the lead engine derailed according to amtrak as well as some passenger cars there were 8 crew members as we noted. approximately 139 passengers. they say there were injuries reported and local authorities are on the scene responding. more information will be provided as available. that is an official statement just coming in to our news room. i was on the amtrak train 	between washington and new york on friday. i mention that only to say this is something we frequently do in the north-northeast corridor. it is very safe. this happens very rarely. and that's why it is a big  big deal. obviously when there are dertsdeaths  there are injuries. there are trains crossing america every day on amtrak and most of them are very safe. we routinely get on them for work  for pleasure and something like this is just shocking. rachel: devastating. todd: what was that? ed: we're getting more information. todd: being rail based freight. you see those cxs trains all over the country. they basically bring the products that that we utilize in america in addition to truckers and ship on the ocean  csx is a huge provider of freight. there is a map so you get a geographical sense so you 	know where cayse is in south carolina. individuals being brought to two hospitals. this is in and around the columbia  area for those not necessarily familiar with south carolina. and so hopefully  hospitals will be enough for the injured. rachel: and a shelter being set up. where did you say ed the shelter was at? ed: at the pine ridge middle school in south carolina in the casey arethekays area -- ca. traveling from new york city down to miami presumably in the winter. some getting some vacation time and all of a sudden this awful  horrible accident. it's looking like it's about 52 degrees but feels like 40 	because of the wind chill there. obviously still very early in the morning. and this happened in the middle of the night. 2:35 a.m. eastern time. people trying to save lives as we speak right now. as we mentioned at least 25 people at a local hospital there. but then others who are not injured  just trying to get to shelter. pine ridge middle school in the area of case  south carolina  is where people need to go. rachel: about 19 or 20 minutes  we will be getting a media briefing so we can get more details from the authorities. todd: trying to find some silver lining with all of this. while i may not have heard of cayse  south carolina  it is in the columbia  south carolina metro area which implies you have a major university there which at thitypically has major medical facility which has major hospitals associated with it these injured should be in good hands. i'm not implying that those of us in the more rural parts of our country aren't. oftentimes if this happens in the middle of nowhere it 	can take a long time to get the injured to a hospital. fortunately if you can say that in this kind of a situation  there are local hospitals rather close by because columbia is a major city will in south carolina. rachel: deputies on the scene right now trying to help those off the train  trying to help those get to the hospital  those that need it. so  yeah  very  very tragic. and you are right. when these kinds of accidents happen in a more rural area  time is of the essence. ed: hearing there might be multiple go teams. i mentioned one before. sheriff's deputies in the area responding to the scene. i'm noticing on social media a lot of people tweeting us that it's pronounced kay-see. we have more ""fox & friends"" right after this. ♪ wil 	pssst. what? i switched to geico and got more. more savings on car insurance? a-ha. and an award-winning mobile app.

been taken to at least two local hospitals in the columbia  south carolina area. specifically happened  a lead engine derailed as well as some passenger cars when that lead engine of the amtrak collided with a csx freight train. we are expecting a briefing from the authorities there in about 15 minutes. ed: we're getting brand new video. we are racking that as we speak. producers are working extra hard and have been doing a fabulous job of getting something that literally happened shortly before we went to air. 	and we have just gotten fresh video out of cayse  south carolina. you are obviously seeing still photos now. we are turning that video  you will see in a moment. first look at what is happening on the scene. here's what we can tell you about what we know about what federal officials are trying to do to get to that scene. here's the new video. you can see it right now. it's obviously dark. on the east coast here  looking out the window here at new york city it's still pretty dark as well. this is the winter time  obviously. very cold here. we have seen it's maybe in the 40's or 50's. not as bad in south carolina as people try to get to shelter at what we're told is the pine ridge middle school in the cayse  south carolina area. that video shot a little bit from the distance. emergency personnel trying to get to the scene. and the nbc ntsb. the national transportation safety board who tries to get to incidents like this rachel you know that very well having just been through a horrible incident 	a few days ago in virginia. the ntsb says they are launching a go team to investigate this collision of an amtrak train going from here in new york city down to miami  florida and colliding with a csx freight train near cayse  south carolina. rachel: this accident happening around 2:30 in the morning. sleeper cars. very frightening situation. trying to find safety and gather with loved ones to the middle school  the pine ridge middle school. those who weren't taken to the hospital and those who needed shelter  that's where they are going. the pine ridge middle school. and we know authorities  lots of authorities  can you see from that video seems to be a lot of help there trying to help those. ed: sheriff deputies and others trial to respond. first responders  easy to forget about this. in incidents around the country  not enough people thank our law enforcement  our first responders who in 	the middle of the night getting quie ready for a quiet weekend  the super bowl in a few hours. you kant see much in that video  but  what can you see is clearly sirens with people responding. in fact  i believe right now on the telephone we have the chief of public information for south carolina emergency management derek becker. we appreciate you joining us right now. can you please tell us  everybody in the fox news audience  what you know about the situation  sir. >> yes  sir. well  as you might expect  we're still getting information still coming in. can confirm at least two facilities  lexington county has confirmed two fatalities and at least 70 people transport to the hospital with nonlife threatening injuries at this point. we have established a shelter i think that was mentioned before at one of the nearby middle schools for all the passengers who are on board the train. now  if there is anybody who has -- they have loved ones on this train they can 	actually get information from amtrak directly by calling 1-800-523-9101. of course the focus is on the safety of everybody that was on board that train. everybody has what they need to stay warm. we are expecting them to be a little cold. even cold for south carolina. and so  right now  we're making sure they have a warm place to stay at the shelter while we clear the scene. todd: 91 for families who might be concerned about families traveling from new york to miami. correct? >> right. anybody with any questions involving the passengers on amtrak train 91 can call 1-800-523-9101. todd: do we know what the items were in the csx train? >> we believe at this point it was diesel. 	todd: when it's a diesel situation  do you have hazmat on scene. >> absolutely. just to make sure everybody is safe. hazmat crews. everything is safe at this point. there is no danger to anyone in the nearby area of lexington county of cayse  of pine ridge it actually happened about a mile away from the south carolina state emergency operation center. so  we're functioning in sort of a supporting role for those local first responders and making sure that they -- if they need any resources  we can get it to them very quickly. ed: derrec  thi this is ed henry we have rachel campos duffy as well. you confirm that we had heard there were two dead you raised the number from 50 injured to at least 70. i want to ask you a little bit more about that. it sounded like some positive news that i want to 	pass along and i want to reiterate that you say out of the at least 70 injured  all or most were nonlife threatening injuries? >> that's correct. and that was new information that we got from lexington county. obviously numbers like that  total numbers can change when you have a very active and ongoing incident like this. report are anything from cuts and scrapes  we do have some reports of a couple of broken bones. but  at this point  nonlife threatening injuries. todd: mr. becker  we are being told by our producers who are getting this information  of course  through their various source thafers some of the cars are so badly damaged that police are having difficulty getting to people inside those cars. is that accurate? >> that's one of the things that we're trying to determine at this point. like i said before  it's still a very active and ongoing scene. we are attempting to ascertain and make sure we have gotten everybody off the train. it's possible that there could be additional information  a little bit later from now. we are doing a media 	briefing in about 10 minutes. so  i need to run real quick so we have the most up to date information. ed: we appreciate it derek becker with south carolina emergency management. we understand he has more important things to do. getting information out is important but tending to those with injuries and getting to the bottom of the situation. we appreciate his time. we will try to reestablish with him. rachel: diesel  he mentioned diesel. that browft alarm to me. i know in the crash i was in this week the train crash i was in the amtrak train crash  that was a big concern. they could smell gas and they were worried about explosions. good to hear that they said they have what they. ed: hazmat team. you are right. we want to pass on positive news u.s. not just deaths and not exaggerate the situation more injuries than anticipated. we heard 25 sent to a hospital. then we heard at least 50 injured. now that number climbing to 	over 70 injured. on the upo positive side at least. we are hearing in early reports  and this can change  these are initial reports. that most or all of those 70 hurt have minor journalist. nonlife threatening. he was mentioning derrec becker did some cuts and scrapes. broken bones. we don't want to minimize it but hopefully not a climb in the number killed. rachel: he also mentioned and you brought that up  ed  that they were having trouble accessing some of the passengers because of the damage to the car. one of the things i was really impressed with this past week in my experience was how professional amtrak was. they went up and down the isles multiple times trying to make sure there was not passenger injured and possibly left behind. they were checking and double-checking and triple checking that. ed: that's a great point. you can see from the video wee have shown from a moment ago it's still dark there  cayse  south carolina. two dead  more than 70 injured. we are told most of those nonlife threatening. 	amtrak train number 91. if you have a family member or friend who might have been traveling between new york and miami. obviously  there is a lot of stops there in between  so  got to czech the ticket. got to figure out who might have been there. but amtrak train 91 collided with a csx freight train carrying diesel fuel 2:35 a.m. eastern. todd: there is humanity to this situation. these are loved ones on the train. we just got news moments ago that everyone is off the train. so that is a little good news. however  if you think that your relative is on amtrak train 91  the phone number to call for information is 1-800-523-9101: keep in mind these individuals that were injured  the 70 that ed and rachel have mention have had been taken to local hospitals in the columbia  south carolina area. which is about five minutes  five miles  i should say 	there in lexington county from where this train did derail. again  the number on your screen  if you think you may have loved ones that are involved. rachel: the rest of the passengers who are not injured  they are being taken to pine ridge middle school. remember  they are stranded. they have nowhere to go. it's dark. it's in the middle of the night. they were probably on the way to vacation. ed: they may not be from this local area. some people may be getting off near here and may have family that can drive there and go get them to safety to pick them up. others originating here from here in new york city or may have been returning home to miami there is a lot of stops  obviously  up and down the eastern seaboard. we are going to take a break in a few seconds here as we reset this because we want to get back real quickly to this news briefing. we just spoke with derek becker in south carolina emergency management. two dead. at least 70 injured. on the positive side at least of those 70 injured 	they believe to have nonlife threatening injuries. we will hear more from the officials right after this break. ♪ ♪ when you

"4741",2018-02-04 07:00:00,"2018-02-04 07:00:00","2:35 a.m. this morning. we believe that there was diesel in the csx train. at least that's what one of the police who called in earlier told us. lead engine derailed as some well as some passenger cars. 8 crew members. 139 passengers. two fatalities. 70 people in the hospital. or most are nonthreatening injuries. shelter for passengers is open at pine ridge middle school. if you believe that you have a family member who might have been on that amtrak train  amtrak has provided a phone number and that's 1-800-523-9101. ed: we're just hearing from the red cross  by the way that they have established sight. we had mentioned earlier they were headed there but they are now at that pine ridge middle school trying to help out. we have had this fresh video you can see from the lexington ledger. it doesn't show a lot because it's still dark here in the east as it is in  of course  all around the 	country as you are just waking up  getting this horrible news. this tragedy. two people killed at least 70 hurt. we are at least hearing from decker becker who you mentioned a moment ago  rachel from the south carolina emergency management team was kind enough to hop on the phone and say out of those 70 hurt. they believe most or all are nonlife threatening emergencies. cuts and scrapes  some broken bones. don't want to manipulate mize it obviously still very serious. but we are hoping that that number on the left of the screen in terms of the number killed is not going to climb. todd: hazmat team on scene to deal with the diesel that was in the csx train and set the geo graphic call seen for you where this happened. cayse  south carolina. borders in richland counties in that general area. columbia  south carolina is the main city in and around this region. that is fortunate. in a situation like  this because presumably the 	university of south carolina has a robust medical staff there. multiple hospitals to deal with a population center like columbia  south carolina. also  a research hospital should have some of the best doctors in and around the south carolina area there. so those injured albeit with nonlife threatening injuries according to public information officer derek becker. they should presumably be getting the best of care and quickly because it's only about five miles from columbia  south carolina. ed: and  in fact  there is going to be a news briefing any moment. we want to assure you are that the fox news team here up bright and early on this sunday is monitoring that situation. it's the office of emergency management within the state of south carolina that we will be holding that briefing. they initially said about this time. about 6:30 a.m. eastern time. as you can understand under the circumstances they are trying to collect as much information as they can save as many lives  get the situation stabilized with the diesel fuel that todd just mentioned. so that's -- those are their priorities. 	but then they want to let the public know because there is  you know  139 passengers as you mentioned  8 crew members. a lot of people in the winter time are going between new york and miami  florida. vacations. there are other people who have jobs up and down the east coast. but there could be a lot of families that are traveling. rachel: or elderly people on the train as well. you have to imagine  i mean  this is happening in the middle of the night. 2:35 in the morning there are no seat belts on amtrak train. being awaken with a jolt. the sound is just scaring. todd: you were on one. three since december. three derailments. rachel: you said this was with csx  that means this was a huge impact. sound was very loud. todd: we don't know where the individuals killed were from. were they on the csx train? were they passengers on the amtrak train? obviously we're going to get details. keep in mind  this collision happened less than four 	hours ago teams responding to the scene as quickly as possible. it's great information that as we know at this point everybody is out of the damaged train. so  some good news at this point in time. we had earlier reports that police were having difficulty getting to some cars because they sorp badly damaged. but the latest update like we just said  everybody is out of the train cars involved in this collision. ed: obviously they still could be searching. they say that in the initial reports. looking out the window here in new york city. it's still very dark. you can see the light there some of that siren. some emergency management lights being brought in to get people to shelter. get people to safety as quickly as they can. we always have to remember that initial reports can change as an investigation unfolds  so the numbers can go up. the numbers can go down in terms of numbers injured or killed. rachel: so good to look on the bright side. again  only 70 people hurt. all minor injuries. there was no explosion. they hit a diesel. 	ed: a truck  pardon me  a freight train fuel of diesel fuel as you say  rachel  this could have been far  far worse. already tragic with two killed and many injured but with diesel fuel in that freight train presumably traveling at high speed  this could have been a lot  lot worse. >> todd: in your experience on trains guys  do they slow them down at this late hour overnight or speed them up? rachel: that's one of the questions we are going to have how fast was this train going? todd: people sleeping. one of those things where the speed they just zip through? ed: i know we learned from the incident in 2015 which i remember very well because at the time this was happening between new york and washington. and it was amtrak train 188. and we have learned from this situation that incident 	that the speed limit  at least in that area  was 50 miles per hour. and as it entered a sharp curve  around the philadelphia area  that was back in may 015  that amtrak train was traveling at twice the speed limit. todd: right. ed: that's why it derailed and that's why you ended up having 8 people killed and more than 200 injured. obviously sparked all kinds of investigations and whatnot. so when you ask about the speed  i remember from that incident that the speed limit at least in that part of the northeast corridor is supposed to be 50 miles per hour. we have to get more information. and we hope to have this briefing any moment there in south carolina. cayse  ace mentioned  right near columbia  south carolina. and the emergency management team there is trying to get on top of this situation. they seem in the early moments  early hours  to be doing just that. and when we had derek becker hop on the phone just a few moments ago  he seemed like he and his colleagues were getting on top of the 	situation. rachel: obviously. those not injured taken to the hospital being taken to the pine ridge middle school. obviously these people are traveling on vacation or whatever. and have no place to go. it's in the middle of the night or at least the early hours of the morning. ed: if you had not heard us earlier  amtrak has given limited information so far. they obviously  in fairness  they are trying to get on top of this situation. they have a phone number  1-hundred-523-9101. if you believe you have a family member  a relative. you see it right there on the screen. shelter for passengers at the pine ridge middle school as rachel mentioned. we believe from the initial reports that all passengers are now off that train. rachel: although they did have trouble getting to passengers because there was so much damage. ed: in the initial hours. remember  we are now four hours into this. it happened about 2:35 a.m. eastern time just after 6:37 a.m. eastern time. now here in the east we expect the news conference any moment. 	you are going to want to stick here because we are trying to get this information to you as quickly as possible. todd: key element to keep in mind. this happened at 2:30 a.m. what were you doing at 2:30 a.m. in the morning. likely sleeping. the people on the train were in all likelihood sleeping as well. as well as the first responders. can you imagine in a situation like this where it is a major train collision  yes  all first responders have people on stand by sunday morning at 2:30 in the morning. but a number of people had to get woken up out of bed to rush to a scene that fortunately is relatively close to a major city  at least for south carolina there in columbia  south carolina. looking at the pictures right now  there is an intense response from first responders. keep in mind this is not right next to knox where have you hundreds of people ready to go at a moment's notice. it does seem like a pretty 	robust response at least looking at these pictures. ed: third amtrak crash since december. rachel knows that. this is the second one. virginia area on the way from washington  d.c. and west virginia for the republican retreat. rachel: that's right. for the republican retreat. in that case the train was going 67 miles per hour. the speed limit was 60 miles per hour. so you mentioned earlier  another train crash. ed: where the speed limit was 55 miles per hour around philadelphia  very busy part for amtrak in the northeast corridor and it was going twice that speed. todd: at this point in time i know a number of people when they hear. let's call it what it is it is a mass casualty incident. although fortunately it does appear for the 70 people injured they are relatively minor injuries. of course  in this day and age where do our minds go initially? 	it goes to fierce of terrorism and things of that nature. we have received no information that this is anything other than a collision between two trains. obviously in a situation like this  four ours in  we are working our sources to find out the very latest information. at this point in time it does appear to be a train collision. when you everywhere on the train this week that was your initial instinct. rachel: right. you hear that sound. obviously we have had very intense political season. we have had attacks on republicans shootings. obviously we are on a train full of congress. can i imagine that sound amplified for these four passengers this morning because they hit a freight train. and you have to wonder why are two trains on the same track? there is going to be a lot of questions about the speed. about that question. hopefully we will get some answers. ed: we do hope to get those answers. we are hearing four the podium is being set up and 	there is some movement there in the area of cayse  south carolina where the emergency management team  state emergency management team will  in fact  be holding a news conference literally any moment now. we will go there live as soon as we see those members of the team there is a microphone we are told that's now been added can i see it right there. the left of the scene. the right of the scene is there are some people walking towards the microphone. it has not quite yet started yet as you can see. we want to go there as soon as they do start speaking. we spoke earlier to derek becker who is with that emergency management team in south carolina. he gave us some very important information which is that initially we had heard that there were about 25 people rushed to a hospital maybe around 50 who 	were injured. and it looks like someone is ready talk attachment. >> information. thumb's up when you are ready okay. good. okay. good? >> i'm going to very briefly just number one thank you for coming out this morning and especially under these circumstances. my name is derec becker with the south carolina emergency management situation. we are supporting lexington county with whatever they may need. any facilities or any sort of resources that a local first responders may need or that amtrak even might need  we are here. we have not activated the state emergency operation center in terms of a full activation lining like you are used to. we do have a limited crew. i am going to give you very 	briefly the run down of who is going to speak largsson kay hill public information officer for lexington county. then captain adam myric and langley from the red cross. i will turn it directly over to harrison. >> good morning  everybody. just give you a brief statement on what we have got going on here. lexington county emergency management as well as their fire service and e.m.s. responded to the charleston highway  pine ridge intersection in reference to a train derailment. at about 2:45 this morning  when we arrived on scene  we immediately began assessing the situation. what we found was two different trains with passenger train and a freight train that collided. what we immediately went into was a search mode. search and rescue mode. we were able to begin to extract and assist passengers off of that train. at this time all passengers are off of the train. that is very important to 	put out there. unfortunately  there were two fatalities as a result of this collision. we are working with the coroner's office here in lexington county very closely with that. at this time we have transported about 70 patients with various injuries to local area hospitals. one thing that i would like to point out is the extreme cooperation between all of the entities you see here. including the list goes on  including city of columbia  rich land county  fort jackson  sert  all of those have been moving in this operation to assist to make sure all of this is taken care of appropriately. i will go ahead and turn it over to captain adam myrick. and tell you about their agencies involved in this incident. >> good morning  i' m last name myrick. here to tell you a little bit about our role in this response this morning. 	we are on scene making sure that that scene remains secure. that is really the top foe consultation of our units that are near the crash site to make sure the scene remains secure. that means everyone can then work as they need to. the first responders will be safe there and we are working alongside all of the agencies that are here. as mr. kay hill mentioned there are a number of them. we are also teaming one state troopers to control traffic in the area. we have some traffic checkpoints  not checkpoints but traffic control points that we are also working  making sure that we have the proper access and those who need to access the site can get there those who don't quite just yet  we are keeping those at a location and at a safe distance  so we as first responders can do our work. something else the deputies have done here in the last hour or so is we have transported those who are not injured to the reception 	site. so we know that they're shaken up quite a bit. we know this is unlike anything else they have ever been through. we wanted to get them out of the cold. out of the weather. get them to a warm place. we have transported them in our units to the reception site  which is going to be opened up by the american red cross. with that i will turn it over to langley from the american red cross to tell you about the operation there at the reception site. >> good morning  everybody. my name is cuthbert  langley. langley. spokes personal for the red cross. we are opening up that reception center at pine ridge middle school. we have a dozen volunteers or staff on their way here or here right now. staff members and volunteers are coming from across the state to assist with this effort. we have emergency response vehicle that's coming as well that will be at the reception site to provide water and snacks and those sorts of things. we are going to continue to 	work with the government partners you see up here with first responders and assist them as the investigation and as the day progresses. again  the red cross is going to be here for as long as needed. we will step n any way that we are asked to help. today is a tragic day for some people and the red cross will be here for as long as we are needed. thank you. >> all right. at this time any questions? >> any road blocks at this point. >> right now the only road blocks would be pine ridge drive. the one that runs right here next to emd all wait down to 321. >> can you characterize the 70 injuries? >> i will let harrison take care of that for you. >> sir  the 70 injuries range obviously in variety. anything from small scratches and bumps to more severe broken bones. so they kind of run the gamut in between that. >> are they nonlife threatening. >> at this time i don't have that information but i can get that information. >> can you go over again the basics of what happened here? 	i wasn't here at the very beginning  just so i have some details what happened this morning? >> yeah. so there was a train collision and derailment near charleston highway and pine ridge drive between a freight train and a passenger train. when we arrived on scene  we began assisting passengers off of that train. at this time there are no passengers on the train. it's very important to put that out. there were about 70 passengers that were transported to local area hospitals for various injuries. there were two fatalities according to the lexington county coroner's office. that has been confirmed. and right now we are also asking people that if they have any concerns or want more information to call amtrak info line. that number is 1-800-523-9101. again that's the amtrak info line. 	1-800-523-9101. >> fatalities. >> at this point i don't have that information. that will probably come out either from csx or lexington county coroner's office. >> do you have any idea how fast the trains were traveling. >> no. at this point no. we just know they collided on the tracks. >> any idea why they collided? >> not at this time. that will be up to the investigation of csx and the ntsb. >> hazardous materials on the csx train. >> there was about -- our hazmat team did respond. we were able to secure two leaks of fuel from the trains. right now we are estimating about 5 000 gallons of fuel has spilled. we have called in dehec and csx's deheck team to secure that cleanin leak and we're asss as much as we can. >> no threat to the public at this time. >> no threat to the public at this time. >> derek  i'm sure every year you guys -- 2005 -- any 	time you hear of a train wreck that immediately comes to mind. can you talk about the amount of training that goes into. >> this is not our first train derailment. you mentioned the incident in 2005. this is nothing like that. unfortunately we have many more people who were affected directly by this incident. it's unfortunate that we have two fatalities. our hearts are with those families right now. we want to make schumer right now the focus is on the passengers on that train  that they have some place warm that any unmet needs that they may have that those are being attended to. but we do have extensive training. working with our local first responders and our county emergency managers in terms of who calls who? where do you go to get resources? how can we reach out to any of the train companies and so forth? so  you're absolutely right. it's something we look at every sing dwell year. >> okay. anything else? >> anything the public can do to help at this point? >> right now stay away from this area. if you were going to come to pine ridge for whatever 	reason  might be best to delay your trip or your plans for the next couple of hours. if there's anything that any information  call that amtrak number that harrison just gave. if there is anything that we can do or any information that you might need  especially if you have a loved one who was on board that train  call that telephone number and harrison can give it right here directly in just a minute. okay? >> how is it going to impact traffic flow? certain area that's cordoned off. >> fortunately  this is a relatively low trask area in terms of especially on a sunday. highway 321 traffic impairment will be minimal. >> can you talk about i guess the span of wreckage? quarter mile? half a mile. >> that's one of the things we are trying to determine and get more information for you. we have that type of thing and especially in regards to what the ntsb is doing. what amtrak will be doing. that will all come out a little bit later. we will try to have another 	briefing as we have more information. this will be the joint information area the media briefing area. any official information about this incident will come from right here. of course  you guys telephone numbers. if anything comes up  give us a call  okay? thank you very much. todd: all right. back here in new york. you are looking at pictures right there. we are just hearing from derek becker the public information officer in that area to discuss the specifics of what just happened. as we know at this point  two people are dead  70 people hurt in a collision between an amtrak train  train number 91. and a csx train. there were a few things from that news conference that stood out to me. they don't know where the fatals are from. leading to 5 000 gallons spilled no. threats to the public at this time. this is a little bit contradictory to what we 	heard earlier. when harrison cahill  the state emergency management division  they didn't know whether there were no life threatening injuries. he said they would look into it. we do know of scrapes and broken bones. but when asked are you officially saying there are no life threatening injuries he? couldn't answer that. rachel: he can't answer that because if you are on blood thinners and you break your leg  that is life-threatening injury. todd: great point. rachel: that's something we thought about often. a small injury for somebody on medication could become very serious. listen  this happened at 2:35 in the morning  todd. they hit a diesel freight freezing rain. there are no seat belts on a train. people had to have been thrown from their seats and jolted in a very powerful way. ed: yeah. also officials saying they do not have info on speed. in terms of how fast either train was traveling either the passenger train or the 	freight train. they do not have information yet on why they collided. obviously that's going to be the focus of their investigation. the officials in lexington county  who started this news conference saying that they responded within 10 minutes  about 2:45 a.m. eastern time. and that they imimmediately went into search and rescue mode. they were able to get everybody off the trains as we heard. two deaths. about 70 injuries. still getting a handle on that. and i think that's remarkable. two leaks of fuel. 5 000 gallons of diesel fuel we were told has spilled and  yet  they say that they have secured it  at least for now  and that the public is safe. that is something obviously everybody in that area is going to be paying close attention to. rachel: thank god for the red cross. i felt so good when i heard that gentleman talking from the red cross saying we have taken everybody out. we are making sure they are not cold. taking them to pine ridge middle school where they are right now. getting them snacks. making them warm and feel 	comfortable. you have to imagine this was a traumatic experience for them. ed: we will be following this along with a lot of other stories this morning. todd: with that we will take a very quick

sunday morning. todd: out of south carolina  two people dead. 70 more injured after amtrak train collision and derailment in south carolina. the amtrak train heading from new york to miami derailing in cayse outside of columbia  south carolina. 139 passengers. 8 crew members on board. police end ago news conference moments ago. take a listen. >> 70 injuries in variety anything from small crashes and bumps to more severe broken bones. ed: you can see from this picture some of the train cars knocked off the tracks. all passengers are now off the train  we're told. some heading to a nearby middle school for shelter. rachel: the nbc are on scene and we'll bring you the latest details as we get them. he haded what he really shock me more than anything  obviously two people dying  horrific. rachel: yeah. 	on top of that  70 injured. but when you hear the officials say at this news conference a couple moments ago that 5 000 gallons of fuel spilled out because this was a freight train with diesel fuel 8 crew members. 139 passengers. they say they have it secure and people in the local area are safe. this could have gotten a lot worse. rachel: that's what i call a miracle that nothing exploded that we have as few injuries as we have. although they are very tragic. i felt from the news conference very confident that these officials had things under control and so happy to hear that the red cross was working to milwaukee those involved in the crash comfortable at the middle school. todd: you literally just experienced a train crash this week. rachel: dierks of course. not on the scale of this which makes my heart go out even more to those who 	obviously lost their lives but those who experience this. it's very scary. this happening at 2:35 in the morning. they are probably sleeping. there are no seat belts on trains. jolted from their sleep. worried about their loved ones. dark at night. ed: cold. rachel: very scary experience for them. very scary. ed: traveling from new york city to miami  florida. this is something that obviously happens a lot in the winters in terms of people heading south. trying to get to the warmer climate. rachel: of course. ed: people starting a new week. the local officials jumped on this very quickly. they said within 10 minutes of the collision they had the emergency management team on the scene. todd: in case you are just waking up  learning about this train collision in south carolina and wondering about your family members  there is a phone number to call it is 1-800-523-9101. 	that's the number to call to find out more. this was amtrak train 91. you see the stats up there on your scene. two dead  about 70 injured there is a shelter for passengers open at the pine ridge middle school. again  the key point that we want to reiterate. all passengers are off the train at this point in time. those 70 injured have been taken to hospitals in and around the columbia  south carolina area. two hospitals in particular. but  again  if you think you have a loved one on that train  please call that amtrak number. ed: obviously super sunday. you have a super bowl today. this puts things into perspective and to focus very  very quickly. football game palg in comparison to people fighting for their lives. two people losing their lives. 70 injured. the initial report suggest that those 70 injured have relatively minor injuries  cuts and scrapes. but as rachel mentioned 	earlier  you simply don't know. a broken bone for an elderly person is different than for an 18-year-old. they have to -- they have officials at the hospital working through all of this trying to keep those numbers down and get everybody safe. rachel: those numbers climbing. initially we thought 20-some injured. then it 50  and then it went to 70. that's what happens when you get early reports. todd: at this point in time we don't know where those fatalities came from. whether they were the people on the amtrak train or crsk freighter. we keep coming back to 5 000 gallons of diesel spilled. hazmat teams on the scene right now evaluating the situation but telling us that there is no threat to the public at this point in time. ed: officials saying they don't know how fast either train was going. that will be a focus of the investigation. they don't know the key question which is why did they collide? rachel: they secured the area. that's one of the things 	that the captain myrick from the sheriff's department let us know they have absolutely secured the area. they have gotten everybody off the train. i can tell you from my experience this week amtrak was very procialg after that crash going up and down double  triple checking to make sure that nobody was left hibsd. ed to these are brand new images just in to fox news of the train collision there in cayse  south carolina. for those of you who may not be familiar with that area it is about five miles from columbia  south carolina. as we have been mentioning throughout the morning that is fortuitous in this kind of a situation because university of south carolina is there. medical facilities. all the levels of trauma center that you would need in a situation like this at the ready because of the proximity to columbia  south carolina. i know i did not know about kazee  south carolina  prior to the last two hours here fortuitous that it is in that general area so close to a major university and city. ed: i just got a note from one of our viewers who said 	he ran a locomotive 10 years and big question whyy the trains on the track at the same time. was it a faulty switch in did the train pick the switch? was the switch thrown against them or was someone negligent? obviously this is what the nbc anntsb and others will be doing to investigate. what is he also saying in terms of keeping the casualties down  he said hopefully the freight train knocked the much lighter built passenger train off the rails instead of actually going through it. which would have obviously been a much more horrific tragedy. todd: subject upsumming up  at t two people dead and 70 injured between amtrak train and csx freighter carrying diesel fuel. those injured have been taken to two local hospitals to be evaluated at this point in time. we know those injuries appear to be scrapes up to broken bones. as we have mentioned a broken bone for some person can be a life-threatening injury. we don't want to say 	everybody is completely off the hook at this point. the scene there under control. no -- the hazmat team is there but there is no concern for the public or the diesel spilled that we will keep you posted on. ed: we mentioned the ntsb is sending a go team there. we will see whether the president has anything to say about this fema or other federal officials get involved here. the ntsb sending a go team helps get this under control so it's not like the entire federal government has to jump on it in the meantime  the president has also over the last 24 hours been tweeting about the story that had been dominating the headlines before all of this is that republican fisa memo that has taken an already volatile situation in terms of all of the russia investigations and blown it up even more and the president pretty much feeling like he has been and i have indicatevindindicated bye memo released on fridays. president pointing out it 	points out the disturbing fact that the fbi and fisa appear to be used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath. the fbi failed continue to form the fisa court that the clinton camp had funded the dossier. the fbi became a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy. and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law. the fbi wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators. the president add allege line there that he was quoting a story in the ""wall street journal"" about all of this. you can see what's instantly happening. the ""new york times"" full story today suggesting that the president is attacking law enforcement anti-law enforcement. we are going to get into that. ed: the president is pushing back and change the narrative. rachel: this memo vindicates all the things i have been saying. important to note the information we got from the fisa memo is significant 	because even the very lowest level agent at the fbi that you never would use opposition research paid for by the opposing party as evidence for a fisa warrant to spy on an american. on a presidential campaign and on a sitting president. this is very serious stuff. and i think it's really foundational to who we are. we are not a police state. and it's interesting that democrats are saying you are undermining the fbi. adam schiff great article in the ""wall street journal"" about that. he was somebody who used to be very concerned about the abuse of fisa warrants. he has changed his tuna little bit. todd: we want to listen to a sound bite from donald trump jr. on the vindication and we will go into more detail. take a listen. >> there is a little bit of sweet revenge in for me and probably the family in a sense that if they wouldn't have done this  this stuff would be going on. this would be going on at the highest levels of 	government. they would be continuing to do it to my father. trying to undermine his actions. imagine how effective he can be given the year he has had without this cloud over his head. i want them to come. but come to a conclusion already. have you been looking for two years. have you come up with nothing other than their own nefarious actions and their own collusions. they have come up with nothing. so  at this point  you got to come to something. like just come to something. todd: with that as the back drop. weave asked so many of our guests yesterday the $64 000 question. should this be the end of the russia investigation? quite frankly  rachel  there is a split amongst republicans. the number of republicans say this should be the end of it individuals like trey gowdy no  let bob mueller finish what he started. ed: yeah  absolutely. saying this is bad for the fbi. this is bad for the justice department but that does not necessarily mean that the mueller investigation has been tainted. and have you republicans like trey gowdy saying that and beings very direct about that. we're going to talk to jason 	chaffetz. former colleague of trey gowdy and some of these other republicans like devin nunes who have been in the middle of all of this in just a couple minutes. rachel: absolutely. right now we are going to turn to your headlines. christian broadcasting network founder pat robertson recovering after suffering from a stroke. a family member rushing the 87-year-old televangelist to a hospital in virginia after recognizing symptoms. robertson hosts cbn's flag ship show the 700 club where he interviewed president trump during his campaign and after the elections. he is expected to make a full recovery. at least 9 states now considering new laws requiring residents to buy health insurance. that's according to the ""wall street journal."" the proposal coming less than two months after republicans voted to repeal the individual mandate if obama backed affordable -- in the obamacare affordable care act. sorry about that. arguing people should not be forced to purchase coverage. all the states involved maryland  california  and 	new jersey. janet jackson won't be performing at tonight's super bowl halftime show. todd: what? rachel: but prince will be there. jackson shutting down rumors that she'll be dancing alongside justin timberlake. the speculation coming 14 years after their infamous wardrobe malfunction while sharing the halftime stage in 2004. timberlake will apparently be bringing back prince as a hologram. i was wondering as i read that i was very confused. nfl source tells the minneapolis star tribune  however  prince's friends and family say this would be against the late music legend wishes. todd: i know timberlake is talented but i didn't know he could raise the dead. ed: the press says the president is waging war on law enforcement. really? jason chaffetz is here to weigh in next. 	originally discovered... in jellyfish. in clinical trials  prevagen has been shown to improve short-term memory. prevagen. the name to remember. here's something you should know. there's a serious virus out there 	that 1 in 30 boomers has  yet most don't even know it. a virus that's been almost forgotten. it's hepatitis c. hep c can hide in the body for years without symptoms. left untreated it can lead to liver damage  even liver cancer. the only way to know if you have hep c is to ask your healthcare provider for the simple blood test. if you have hep c  it can be cured. for us  it's time to get tested. it's the only way to know for sure. 	for us  it's time to get tested. a little to the left. 1  2  3  push! easy! easy! easy! (horn honking) alright! alright! we've all got places to go! we've all got places to go! washington crossing the delaware turnpike? surprising. what's not surprising? how much money sean saved by switching to geico. big man with a horn. fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 	ed: following the release of the fight memo the media using it to claim the president is waging war on law enforcement. really? todd: take a look at these headlines out this very morning. ""new york times"" trump's unparalleled war on a pillar of society  law enforcement. politico  trump escalates his war with u.s. law enforcement after memo release. and ""the washington post "" once the party of law and order  republicans are now challenging it. rachel: fox news contributor jason chaffetz is former chairman of the oversight and government reform committee and he joins us now. so  jason  what do you think of that? is donald trump and now so many republicans damaging the reputation of the fbi or just talking about the leadership that's corrupt? >> >> good morning. donald trump didn't create this mess but is he here to 	help clean it up. anybody to reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system. and  you know  all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats this was an attack on law enforcement and this is going to dismantle our security apparatus  this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true. none of it. and how ironic in the movie theaters right now have you meryl streep and tom hanks in a move touting the post about how they would print everything and want to get everything out there and now all of a sudden we are trying to expose the truth and what happens they get attacked as saying -- no  donald trump is as pro-law enforcement as any president we have had in my lifetime. and is he trying to clean it up. ed: jason  where do we go from here? because you know and have you been sounding the alarm on this sooner than a lot of people saying yeah  this memo is important. pay attention to the justice 	department inspector general report which may be coming just weeks from now and is going to have more revelations about the fbi  about the justice department. i presume a lot of these attacks in the mainstream media and democrats like adam schiff are only going to increase. what say you about the way forward here in terms of pushing back on that but also actually fixing some of this? >> the inspector general the request that came from me in my office. everything from the james comey firing all the way through the tarmac meeting between loretta lynch and president clinton and all the other things that have happened in between. michael horowitz  450 employees  the inspector general at the department of justice. he has been looking at this. they have been silent. they have been quiet. you haven't heard leaks of this. there was a concern about the text messages between strzok and page. they presented that to mr. mueller. mueller immediately made a change. i think that would be a key indicator that there was 	some real wrong going there mueller looks at it  dismisses the guy. meanwhile he was embedded as the number two person at the fbi. a lot happening. but the inspector general is very important. devin nunes andth intel committee will come out with more reports. it's bigger and broader unfortunately than just the fbi. he mentioned the state department. i think you will see a look at the intelligence community as well. todd: jason  all week we heard the release of this memo is going to endanger national security. the sky is going to fall. we are all going to be dead once this thing is released. still  even though the release has happened and everybody has had time to look and see that there really is no national security imoccasion. we have had numerous experts on here to tell us that the democrats and many in the liberal media are still saying there is a national security issue. but not pointing to any facts. can you help us out? are there any facts there that maybe the three of us are missing? >> adam schiff and the democrats on that committee 	were flailing this was going to destroy the security apparatus. as soon as it comes out democrats changed their talking points and said it's a nothing burger. there is nothing here to see. it doesn't mean anything. you can't have it both ways  folks. you are reading the same memo before and after and you took two paths and you are just misdirecting from the key fact that name names and were very specific within that report. now it's four pages in a massive investigation. but it does illuminate the major systemic problems there at the fbi. rachel: jason  i feel like the president has been pretty clear in some of his tweets that he was separating the leadership  which he thinks has been corrupt and biceed from the rank and file fbi. have you heard from any members of the fbi and members in your community that they feel that separation? even john mccain has came out and said you are damaging the reputation. you are hurting the morale of the fbi. and you are saying clean it 	are already changing because of it. that's coming up next. hi  i'm bob harper  and i recently had a heart attack. it changed my life. but i'm a survivor. after my heart attack  my doctor prescribed brilinta. it's for people who have been hospitalized for a heart attack. brilinta is taken with a low-dose aspirin. no more than 100 milligrams as it affects how well brilinta works. brilinta helps keep platelets from sticking together and forming a clot. in a clinical study  brilinta worked better than plavix. brilinta reduced the chance of having another heart attack... 	...or dying from one. don't stop taking brilinta without talking to your doctor  since stopping it too soon increases your risk of clots in your stent  heart attack  stroke  and even death. brilinta may cause bruising or bleeding more easily  or serious  sometimes fatal bleeding. don't take brilinta if you have bleeding  like stomach ulcers  a history of bleeding in the brain  or severe liver problems. slow heart rhythm has been reported. tell your doctor about bleeding new or unexpected shortness of breath any planned surgery  and all medicines you take. if you recently had a heart attack  ask your doctor if brilinta is right for you. my heart is worth brilinta. if you can't afford your medication  astrazeneca may be able to help. 	ed: we are back with a fox news alert we have been following all morning. brand new picture coming in the newsroom train crash in south carolina killed two people and injuring at least 70. police say injuries vary between scratches  bruises and broken bones. the amtrak train was heading from right here in new york city to miami. derailing in cayse  just outside of columbia  south carolina. 139 passengers. 8 crew members were on board. some of the train cars knocked off the tracks all together. all passengers are off the train now. some heading to a nearby middle school for shelter. 	the nbc and re ntsb and red croe on the scene. we will bring you the latest details as we get them. todd? todd: all right  ed  thank you very much. president trump touting the real impacts of his tax reform bill. take a listen. >> roughly three million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker and that's just over the past six weeks alone. todd: take a look at this headline from the associated press reading. tax bill beginning to deliver bigger paychecks to workers. joining us now  one of those seeing a bigger paycheck  lee and shirley ann do you pray and also joining us cpa pointers on how to use your if youly found money. lee  i want to begin with you. if you don't mind  i don't mean to get too personal here. can you tell us how much money you are seeing in your paycheck? >> a little over $49 a week. todd: tell me what that means to you living in connecticut right now? >> oh  as we all know  we are one of the higher taxed 	states. many factors. last fall i had cancer surgery so i'm a cancer survivor. i have medical bills to pay. so every little bit makes a huge business. todd: have you enjoyed your husband quote unquote crumbs to quote nancy pelosi. >> i always enjoy any dollar increase in paycheck. thanks trump and thanks republicans  we will take it. todd: if i'm not mistaken you are currently looking for work  correct? >> yes. todd: last year you tried and were only able to get one interview. >> in person. todd: now you say because of the tax reform that president trump pushed through  you are seeing a lot more action  a lot more interviews this year. >> very much. so the week after he signed that i got my first in person interview and then two weeks ago i got three in one week. todd: wow  that's a lot. >> i have been able to apply to several jobs this past week there has been more 	jobs available. todd: add more color to this all three of us living in connecticut. it's not chock-full of jobs right now. to be able to get that it shows that the president trump tax plan is even working in the nutmeg state. >> very much  yeah. todd: tell us how you are usersing the money. >> we are savers  we tend to save and pay down debt. and it doesn't just affect us. it makes it to so we can help our children and grandchildren more it spreads out in all different directions. todd: that's how you folks are handling the money. let's bring in dan right now. daniel  i'm seeing more money in my paycheck. what should i do with that money. >> my advice to people in this situation is first and foremost take down debt. take down expensive debt. particularly credit card bills. you don't want to be paying that high interest rate. point 2 if you have the ability to prepay your mortgage  take advantage of that because you will save big dollars over the long term. if you don't have those scenarios  then i would say 	put money into your retirement plan. it's tax deferred. you get double benefit when you do it that way. todd: explain a little bit more about the exponential effect of chipping away at your mortgage and chipping away at your high interest debt? >> so  when you have a situation here where you are going to be saving $50 a week  and that's obviously between $250 a month. if you start to put that towards your mortgage  you will shorten the amount of mortgage time. 30 year you may over time be able to shorten that 25 years. the amount of interest that you save will be significant. thousands and thousands of dollars beyond the amount of money that you would be putting into that prepayment. todd: if i could come back to you folks for a second. i think in the media we always throw around phrases and numbers and we really don't understanding what these numbers mean for real america. again  we will throw nancy 	pelosi under the bulls. she a multimillionaire and called this money crumbs. is there something you want to tell america as to how this really isn't just crumbs to you guys? >> well  nancy pelosi my entirely yearly income would probably be crumbs. you get a fluctuation of it $220 cents gallon of gas impacts our lives. every dollar helps. todd: what is your line of work. >> office manager  bookkeeping  accounting. todd: so if you are looking for an office manager  connecticut  my buddy here  ms. dupre. thanks for coming. in dan  always good to see you. good luck and congratulations on the money. >> thank you. todd: fisa memo sending relationships through the fbi. what does it mean for special counsel robert mueller's investigation? we will ask governor mike huckabee when we come back.","","","","",""

>> good morning  and thank you for having us. we will be having our teams arriving in columbia early this morning  and we will begin immediately with our investigative process. ed: what are the early stages now? we had a news conference  sir  with local officials in south carolina last hour. and they were sailing it's too early to tell  which is understandable about how quickly the speed both trains were traveling at before this collision. and they were also saying it was too early to say why they collided. what's your early sense? you have been through this before. >> yes  indeed  we have been through this. and i suspect that we will have some preliminary information by this afternoon from a number of data sources to be able to pen down the speed of the amtrak train at the point of collision. that's our priority is to -- 	one of our priorities is to recover those recorders and begin a readout of them. ed: my recollection  sir  you are aviator by training but you have had in your position to learn a lot about the train system in this country. give us a big picture because i realize it's early and i don't want to keep pounding about an investigation that's just started. people waking up and see this happen. i ride amtrak all the tile for work. i have to say it's usually very safe. we have to give that context. people are waking up in the united states this morning and seeing that we have now had three crashes just since december. can you give us a big picture of what the ntsb thinks about that and what you are doing to make sure there is not some broader problem? >> well  thank you for trying to keep that somewhat in perspective there. and i think in order for us to be able to comment on the broader picture  we need to really understand what is causing each of these individuals accidents. 	the -- sorry  somebody just handed me a note there. so  the bottom line is that  yeah  let's not try and draw any broad ideas about amtrak right now. let's look at each individual accident and see what's causing them and then the board will be in a better position to comment on that. ed: robert sumwalt from the ntsb. we appreciate your time. we realize it's very early on a sunday morning. you are trying to gets a handle on this situation. please check back with us if you get more information in the next couple of hours. robert sumwalt  thank you. >> thank you  todd. ed: i had would like to turn to mike huckabee former governor of arkansas  fox news contributor. i was on twitter trying to scan through information about this train crash. instead i see governor huckabee get up early sunday morning  get ready for church. i will be on ""fox & friends."" those who watch will sing the hymns better. if you miss it the pastor will point the finger at you 	and scream right at you. sir  can you really back that up? >> absolutely. if you don't watch that segment  all those people who miss it when they get to church this morning the pastor is going to scream at them and call them out. that's why it's embarrassing. that's why they should watch ""fox & friends"" every day. if the president watches  why shouldn't the rest of america. todd: someone screaming this morning leon panetta says he has never seen anything like this in his lifetime like the memo release. let's listen to him and then we will get your reaction. >> when the president distrusts the justice department and the fbi  our primary law enforcement institutions in this country  they're the primary law enforcement agencies under our constitution  and when the president distrusts the fbi and the justice department as he did in this matter  i think it does create a crisis in our system of government. 	todd: governor huckabee  are we in a crisis? >> yeah  we are. the crisis is not because of something that the president has done. the crisis is because of something that the highest officials in the doj and the fbi have done. they have  what apparently appears to be that they have violated the fourth amendment rights of americans by spying on them  using documents that were basically just contrived. they knew they were contrived. they went to a judge. it's really frightening. i have great respect for leon pa net attachment when i'm listening to him. house on fire and firemen came and put water all over my furniture and window. we have got to stop these pfeiffer men from breaking windows and putting water on my furniture. we have to get this in context. ed: context is  governor  what about the fact that some of the most senior government officials that we should be able to trust at the fbi and the department of justice  go to get a fisa 	warrant and fail to tell the judge oh  by the way  the information here in the heat of a presidential campaign  the fall of 2016  we need to surveil someone in the trump campaign and oh  by the way  we are not telling you the information is coming from a dossier paid for by hillary clinton and the dnc. >> that's the problem. if you obtain evidence by doing something dirty to get it  then the evidence is tainted. the legal doctrine is the fruit of the poisonous tree they call it but  it's not unlike a cop who plants drugs on someone in order to get an arrest. if you really out to get somebody  you can probably do it. and even if they don't get convicted and go to prison you have ruined their lives by the time they pay their legal expenses and go through the humiliation of being accused of things. and some people will never believe they're innocent even if later they are proved to be. their lives are destroyed. this is why we must have law enforcement at all levels that is of the highest 	caliber and utmost integrity. look  99.9% of the time we do. when we have a problem with it  you can't just ignore it any more than can you ignore bull conner turning on waters whoswaterhoses and sprayn people in the street. you don't respect that kind of law enforcement. when the law enforcement becomes the law breaker  have you got to stop it  root it out. and turns the lights on and clean it out. that's what has to happen here. rachel: i think that's what devin nunes has been trying to fight tooth and nail for every bit of information. we wouldn't know  governor  the dossier was paid by the hillary campaign and by the dnc had devin nunes not subpoenaed that. and the democrats were fighting for him -- fighting against that subpoena. it's just a huge coverup. >> it is a coverup. i think what maybe disturbs me more than the democrats trying to keep this under wraps because i sort of 	expected that i don't understand how people in the media  people who normally want to expose everything  people who want to make sure that the pentagon papers got published. people who have wanted to make sure that we knew everything about iran contra. people who wanted to make sure that we knew everything about every implication of watergate  and now they suddenly say nothing to see here  let's shut this down. we don't want to see that memo. i had one person respond to me on twitter  a reporter and said oh  yeah  we want to see it i'm not seeing that. i'm seeing many people sitting at their desk pounding their chest saying this is an affront to the constitution. the affront to the constitution is covering it up. ed: all right  the man who will be singing the hymn as little better in church this morning hike huckabee. [laughter] todd: church also be awesome. rachel: i love having him on. todd: the president heading to ohio tomorrow. what do voters in the buckeye state want to hear? why will ask democratic candidate for governor there in the great state of ohio  dennis kucinich  is he coming up next. 	ed: members of the u.s. air force will be soaring above the super bowl tonight. pete hegseth will be here to one of the pilots live in minneapolis. that's coming up. ♪   that seems fair. we didn't use it. wish we got money back on gym memberships. get money back hilarious. with claim-free rewards. switching to allstate is worth it. 	successful people have onthey read more.on. how do they find the time? with audible. audible has the world's largest selection of audiobooks. for just $14.95 a month  you get a credit-good for any audiobook. and you can roll your credits to the next month if you don't use them. audible members get free  no-hassle exchanges... 	...and use the mobile app to listen anytime  anywhere. start a 30-day trial and your first audiobook is free. listening  is the new reading. text ""audio 8"" to five hundred five hundred to start listening today. 	♪ todd: some quick headlines on a very busy sunday morning. russia strikes back after syrian rebels appear to shoot down a fighter jet. the missile attacks killing more than 30 rebels according to russian media. rebels posting video of the destroyed jet with the pilot's body. he ejected but killed while opening fire on the al qaeda linked group. this comes as russian backed syrian forces and rebels intensifies. and thousands of protesters in london demanding more money for britain's failing national healthcare service.

just mentioned the unemployment in your state. coming down. continued under president trump. we have seen the markets taking off and tax cut goes through seems to be juicing this economy as one of the 	leaders in your party nancy pelosi says it's just crumbs. >> well  let me be quite specific. the president is coming to cincinnati. the people in cincinnati  hamilton county have real concerns and here they are. there's a western hills viaduct going to cost 360 million to repair. 50 000 cars a day. they want some action on that. the federal government needs to help. the brent spence bridge that connects ohio and corps of kent. it's a 2.5 billion-dollar project. 160 000 cars a day. we need help on infrastructure in ohio. those projects are critical. and  you know what? people don't want any privatization. they don't want any tolls. and finally  ed  sewer bills have gone up in hamilton county about 400 percent in the last 10 years. the area sunday mandates. the federal government has to help rebuild sewer systems without socking out it -- seeing local rate pairs. ed: i'm not sure the president can do much about sewer bills. >> no  but he can. ed: he can do something about roads and bridges. in all seriousness  the 	president in the state of the union talked about infrastructure he want to get a deal done your colleagues on the democratic side work with him whether it's daca or infrastructure democrats don't want to work with him. here you are in your state saying let's come together what's the disconnect. >> will massive infrastructure needs over $3 trillion nationally. but in ohio specifically  the president is going to be in cincinnati. he can address these issues. sewer systems need to be rebuilt. there's a federal mandate out there that counties and cities can't meet. the federal government has to weigh in. now  parties have to work together. it's absolutely true. are there political differences? you bet there are. but  when we work together  we have to draw the line. no privatization  no tolls. we need to rebuild the infrastructure. the president said he would do in his inaugural speech. i think this is the time. people are expecting him to deliver. ed: you are listening to the voters. are they talking about the 	russia investigation or rather talk about the economy? >> well  you know  there are some people concerned about that. i think most people want to see more jobs. they want to seat infrastructure rebuilt. they want to see their -- they don't want to have to worry when they go across a bridge whether there is going to be any structural problems with the bridge. we have to rebuild america. rebuild ohio. that's what i think people in ohio want. i'm certainly in tune with them on that. ed: congressman  the big question  super bowl

south carolina. two people dead  more than 70 injured after an amtrak train collided with a freight train derailing several cars. >> this is brand-new video just out from the crash site in pine ridge just outside columbia  you can see the trains are absolutely mangled. please ending a presser a short time ago. >> the 70 injuries range obviously in variety. we have anything from small scratches and bumps to more severe broken bones. rachel: brian guinness live following the latest. >> amtrak train 91 was traveling from new york to miami when at 	about 2:35 this morning it collided with a csx freight train. that collision led to the lead engine and a couple of passenger train cars to derail off the tracks. these are the first images we are seeing in daytime. remember  this happened about five hours ago. two dead  unfortunately  in this crash  could authorities. the 70 injured those injuries range from scratches to broken bones as you've been hearing this morning. right now we have the ntsb -- that is the national transportation safety board -- go team en route to this crash right now. these teams are -- leave from washington  d.c. they are the first boots on the ground  so to speak  in this investigation as they now turn to why this happened. those 70 injured have been sent to local area hospitals. remember  there were 139 people on this train  including -- and also eight crew members. those who were not sent to hospitals  there has been a re 	reunification point set up at the local middle school there  pine ridge middle school. now  that reunification center is for passengers to really get out of the elements and maybe get some minor cuts and bruises to be checked out and for that to happen. take a listen right now. remember  this middle school is -- right now this reunification center is being run by the american red cross. >> we are going to step in in any way that we are asked to help because obviously today is quite a tragic day so many people  and the red cross is going to be here to help for as long as we're needed. ed: hazmat teams have responded. there are two leaks. those two fuel leaks have been taken care of  from what we understand. some 5 000 gallons of fuel leaked out because of this crash crash. as we understand  those have been taken care of and pose no risk to the public at this time. we'll keep you updated throughout the morning  guys. rachel: thank you for that. and my heart goes out as all of our hearts go out to all those who were injured and those who lost their lives in this crash. you can see from those images 	those cars are absolutely mangled. it was probably very traumatic to t.em ed: we talked to the head of the ntsb there earlier. they're on top of the situation  they have a go team there. we'll move on to other news and stay on top of that all morning. this weekend has been dominated by the release of the republican memo  it was hashtag release the memo  then it was hashtag memo day. now the president has wanted to turn it into maybe vindication day saying look  enough is enough with the investigating and saying that this shows that from the very beginning of the investigation people in the f.b.i. and the justice department had it out to him. todd: and of course how does the president do that? he tweets. the four-page memo released freeway reports the disturbing fact of how the f.b.i. and fisa has been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath. the f.b.i. failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier. f.b.i. became a tool of anti- anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm 	anyone who wants the f.b.i. to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law. the f.b.i. wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators"" and then cites the wall street journal as the source of that informat.on rachel: president trump coming into office promising to drain the swamp  this looks like swampy stuff. listen  a the fisa approval is a very serious thing. it's probably one of the things that we need maximum trust on. ed: absolutely. rachel: so withholding information is serious filing. i mean  the rules of fisa say don't just tell us what you know you have to tell -- or what we can see. we have to know everything. so if you have a dossier that's paid for by the opposing party in a campaign  the hillary clinton campaign  withheld from judges -- ed: that's a material fact. rachel: it says one of two things  that those specifically tried to mislead the fisa judge or there's not enough oversight and questions  too much trusting 	by the judges  or  god forbid if the judges themselves are corrupt. ed: just try to say ""swampy stuff"" three times stuff. rachel: swampy  swampy. todd: rachel to that point  why that is so important  and i'm going to put a legal hat here. in a normal court  you have a prosecution  you have a defense. here there's nobody fighting for the defense  basically how this works. there is a prosecutor. they provide all the information and then it's the judge who has to sort of put on of ""i'm going to the defense attorney here as well  but at the end of the day i'm the judge."" so that's why that judge needs all the information laid out in front of him to make the ultimate decision. ed: that's why in political context in this situation the lead in the defense is not an attorney  it's the president himself. he goes on twitter  as you say  he pushes back with reporters on friday saying what's in the memo is disgraceful  people should be ashamed of themselves. and jason chaffetz says  look  this is not just about donald trump versus the investigators. this is about real problems and corruption at the f.b.i. and the doj  not with agents out in the 	field  not with the brave men and women who keep us safe in terror cases  but with the leadership that grew corrupt and jason chaffetz who was in the middle of trying to fix this when he was in congress says it's the president who's going to clean it up. >> donald trump didn't create this mess  but he is here to help clean it up. anybody who reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system. and  you know  all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats that this was an attack on law enforcement  this was going to dismantle our security apparatus this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true  none of it. todd: as you might imagine  the mainstream media out with a lot of headlines this morning and it basically pit the president and republicans on one side versus law enforcement. let's take a lookr some of these these. this is mitt romney. ""how conservatives learn to hate the 	f.b.i."" from huffington post  the law and order party has unleashed an extraordinary attack on law enforcement. from washington post: ""once the party of law and order  republicans are now challenging it."" and this is from that article  republican leaders open defiance last week of the f.b.i. over the release of a hotly disputed memo how the f.b.i. which has long positioned itself as the party of law and order has become an adversary of federal law enforcement as the party continues its quest to protect president trump from the russia investigation. i want to toss it over to you folks  rachel and ed  because you know d.c. very well  you know these institutions. i'm going to just comment quickly from my experience at the diners  okay? i go around and i talk to average americans in average americans and we talk to average men and women there. to a man and to a woman they say they love this administration because for the first time in eight years the shackles are off of them  they can do their jobs 	and not worry  they are so excited by this administration  and they are law enforcement  and they are military. again  that's out there. what's going on in d.c.? rachel: if anybody is against law enforcement  it's the left. and you're absolutely right. i live in small-town america. law enforcement loves donald trump. the rank-and-file at the f.b.i. i'm sure is glad to see the leadership that's corrupt cleaned up. if anything  this is a self- self-inflicted wound by the leadership at the f.b.i. who allowed itself to be corrupted with comey and everybody else at the top using their powers to un undo an election and once donald trump was elected  trying to damage him. and we've been spending a year talking about russia. i look at what's in that memo. we have a drunken conversation with a low-level staffer and a dirty dossier. this is embarrassing for the new york times  for everybody else who for one year has tried to change the conversation to russia. and you're right  todd  the american people aren't buying it it. no one's talking about russia and middle america. ed: it's interest because the 	president and  you know  taken from the horse's mouth  what he has actually said about law enforcement  we put it together. watch. >> with me as your president  america's police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the white house  more loyal than anyone else can be  i tell you . [applause] i am the big  big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement  okay? from day one. we have your back  believe me  we have your backs 100%. we celebrate our police  our military  and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering suppor. ed: and in fact it was the president who took all kinds of heat for standing up before anyone else did and said  ""you know what? the folks in the nfl should be standing for the anthem."" he says it's because he thinks 	they should be standing for men and women in uniform  for law enforcement. there are others who are saying ""no  it's about  you know  the first amendment and having peaceful protests."" president said you can have protests  there's peaceful protests  but just respect the flag. so we've got pete hegseth  outreached who's not on the couch today  he's live in minneapolis. pete  it's interesting the man who first stood up and said  "" ""enough is enough  nfl  stand up and honor the flag  honor our men and women in uniform"" is now on defense with people claiming he's against law enforcement. >> it's such a great point. the partisan opposition to this president -- when i say partisan i don't just mean the democrats  i mean the so-called mainstream media is so disingenuous. can you imagine if this was a democratic president targeted bay republican president and d.o.j. they would be going wall-to-wall demanding scalps. instead they're apologizing for democrats and pointing the finger  as you said  at the one guy who has reinstilled confidence in law enforcement who are under siege from accusations  the black lives 	matter movement. so this is political disingenuous. nancy pelosi knows it. and i know this president will continue to fight back 'cause he's had the backs of law enforcement. and to call out the top doesn't mean you're calling out the rank-and-file. it means you're cleaning out the partisan agenda and backing the guys on the ground. rachel: pete  you're so right. if this had been reversed  if george bush had spied on barack obama as a presidential candidate and continued on as a sitting president  not only would they be demanding more and more information and transparency  which they don't want now  which it's fascinating to see the media not want more information  believe me  this would be called racism. this was the attack on the first you know  black president. but it's a white man  it's donald trump  who's politically incorrect  and the media is actually working with the democrats to cover this up. >> well  that's the collusion right there. and they're working with the democrats to try to get enough votes in the house of representatives in 2018 so they can hold the hearings they want 	to hear and release the memos they want to release. in reality  god bless what devin nunes has done in pushing it out out. the discussion will continue. we'll see what phase 2 looks like. but it is very disingenuous and i think as you pointed out  todd middle america will see it. todd: get warm  pete. we'll talk football later. the fisa memo bringing to light some shocking new revelations. our next guest was an f.b.i. agent for 24 years. he says it showed how comey disgraced the honorable bureau. he'll explain when we come back. oh! there's one. manatees in novelty ts? surprising. what's ""come at me bro?"" it's something you say to a friend. what's not surprising? how much money matt saved by switching to geico. fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 	>> republicans on the house intel panel released that controversial fisa memo on friday bringing to light what they say are some pretty 	shocking revelations. todd: joining us now to react is chris schweiker who served 24 years as an f.b.i. special agent agent. sir  with all due respect  to our other guests today this interview is arguably the most important because of your background as an f.b.i. agent. so i'll ask you right off the bat  you've heard other individuals saying the f.b.i. is going to go after the president  the f.b.i. hates the president  this was bad  this is now f.b.i. versus president. how do you react to that? >> i'd say  look  chris ray and you have a the new deputy direct david baudich are going to do no such thing. what we're talking about here say breakdown in the senior leadership of the f.b.i. under jim comey and andy mccabe as deputy director. i would hate for the public to think that the f.b.i. as an institution is flawed or biased. what this is is a very small inner circle of senior leadership under jim comey at a very critical time period  and i 	just don't want this to reflect on the 35 000 very -- you know  the excellent men and women of the f.b.i. who are doing a great job every day. ed: so chris  let's get specific specific. and we've heard the partisan attacks on all sides  people who don't like the president  people who like the president and people who like james comey and don't like james comey. so i think as todd said  it's very important to get your perspective as somebody who was inside the f.b.i. so james comey holds himself out there even today on twitter and instagram as this paragon of virtue  above the fray. you were there for 24 years. how do you think he's paved over the last couple of years  you know  his public performance as f.b.i. director both in the clinton probe and then how he handled president trump? >> well  i had the perspective of serving directly under director murral. i bet i sat in on 500-plus meetings with him and director freeh  and these were two great leaders. they stayed in the background. i never saw a hint of bias. unfortunately  under jim comey  that hubris that you just mentioned caused him to make up 	his own rules -- leaks  permissive leak environment  pre predetermining investigations  a noninvestigation of the clinton email investigation  thumb on the scale on the russian investigation in the beginning here with the fisa applications  and just generally making up their own rules and letting their own political opinions infect their investigation. that is something you learn at the fbi academy. you can't let your personal bias bias. you've got to leave those at home. if not you need to be in another line of business. >> defenders of james comey have said  oh  it's not a big deal that he and andrew mccabe and others were drafting this exoneration statement for hillary clinton months before they even interviewed her. i'm an outsider  we're outsiders we don't know how the f.b.i. does its job. is that the proper way? i mean  people on the outside hear that and say  three months before she was exonerated  they were already drafting the statement. doesn't that sound like it was 	cooked? >> yes  it does. it sounds like the thumb is on the scale. those of us that have done criminal investigations and counterintelligence investigations know that the clinton email investigation was not a real investigation. they never even once used a grand jury that i know of. we're hearing  those of us that are in the retired agent community  we're hearing that deputy director mccabe was expressing his opinions in closed-door meetings all the time about trump  so we're talking about a predetermined investigation. and that is just not how the f.b.i. as a whole operates. todd: that's scary for democrac. ed: we appreciate it  chris schweiker. meanwhile  the president wants to make a deal on immigration. that's what he says  but democrats not bundle. so what does the hispanic community think of the president president's plan? todd: plus now that the fisa memo is out what will happen to deputy attorney general rod rosenstein? we will ask corey lewandowski coming up. 	but what a powerful life lesson. and don't worry i have everything handled. i already spoke to our allstate agent  and i know that we have accident forgiveness. which is so smart on your guy's part. like fact that they'll just... forgive you... four weeks without the car. okay  yup. good night. with accident forgiveness your rates won't go up just because of an accident. switching to allstate is worth it. 	okay  iunderwear that's'd say this  bactually pretty.er leak surprised? it's called always discreet boutique. it looks and fits like my underwear. i know what you're thinking. how can something this pretty protect? hidden inside is a super absorbent core that quickly turns liquid to gel... ...for incredible protection. so i feel protected... ...and pretty. new always discreet boutique. we know that when you're >> tspending time with thelass grandkids... ♪ music >> tech: ...every minute counts. and you don't have time for a cracked windshield. that's why at safelite  we'll show you exactly when we'll be there. with a replacement you can trust. all done sir. >> grandpa: looks great! >> tech: thanks for choosing safelite. >> grandpa: thank you! >> child: bye! >> tech: bye! saving you time... so you can keep saving the world. >> kids: ♪ safelite repair  safelite replace ♪ 	>> christian broadcasting network pat robertson recovering after suffering a stroke. family member rushing the 83 83-year-old televangelist to a hospital in virginia after recognizing symptoms. he interviewed president trump during his campaign and after the election. he is expected to make a full recovery. obviously in our thoughts and prayers. and the u.s. navy commission be its newest combat ship the us uss omaha in san diego. ♪ >> the fourth ship in the naval sheep to bear the name will be manned by 70 sailors. the war vessel designed to be fast and agile will be used for coastal defense. 	philanthropist susie buffett  daughter of warren buffett  gave the $440 million ship's first order. ed: strong and agile  just like donald. staring down a march 5th deadline to strike a deal with democrats on immigration  that's when protections begin expiring for many young immigrants living here illegally. todd: the white house plan includes a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers in exchange for a border wall and more security. rachel: so should democrats finally get on board with this? we're asking daniel garza president of an initiative which works to advance the hispanic community. full disclosure  i used to work there  i was your national spokesperson for a while. >> terrific. rachel: daniel  you're the president of libre. why shouldn't -- first of all  is libre backing the plan? let's start with that. >> we commend the president. we praise what he announced. 	if he feel that some very -- it's a very strong and bold proposal. there are aspects to it that i think merit further consideration like of course the restrictions or the arbitrary cuts to family migration  but overall this is a reason for the democrats to come to the table and finally get a long-term permanent solution. rachel: so libre is will be to come to the negotiating table on this. why aren't other groups  i like at la raza  lulac  why aren't they going to the frustrating table? >> that's been the frustrating part for the latino community  for the democrats honestly it's been a lot of lip service  they have not delivered on any kind of legislation. look  in 2007 george bush was ready to sign a law. frist  who led the senate -- ed: senate leader. >> right  the senate leader of the republican majority passed legislation  and it actually stalled at the desk of nancy pelosi and rahm emanuel. and then barack obama actually had the white house  had the senate  had the house  but did 	not see it as a priority. ed: 2008 barack obama said  ""my first year in office i will get comprehensive."" he made that promise directly to the latino community. todd: is the republican is named joe smith and not donald trump  does this get passed by the democrats? >> i believe so. again  we believe that the arbitrary cuts to family migration is probably the discussion we should be having  more long term  more be packaged for permanent reform that has to do with legal migration. but again this is a reason to come to the table. this is an opportunity right now to finally do something. the president blew everybody away by actually proposing that he would give citizenship to 2018 million daca -- rachel: three times what obama offered  right? >> almost three times that  exactly right. so  look  everything you heard about donald trump  you'd think he would actually maybe reduced that number down  but he actually almost tripled it. 	rachel: he made a deal they really shouldn't be able to refuse. >> no  he did show heart. ed: and talking about results  the president everyone assumed he's going to have the worst relationship with mexico and yet their foreign relations secretary just put out this statement. i think in many ways the relationship today is more fluid it's closer than it was with previous administrations. so is that a negotiating strategy by mexico saying  you know  chuck schumer  put the wall on the table a couple weeks ago  this might be more of a reality than we thought  we've got to kind of reach out to donald trump  or have things actually gotten better despite what the mainstream media -- >> according to the media you would think this is counter counterintuitive  but the negotiations with nafta actually have proven very productive. they are now in their seventh round. at the end of february they're going to be in mexico city  and there are discussions now obviously on food safety  on telecommunications  on digital issues. these are all things that create dialogue  that engender i think a relationship that has been very positive with mexico. and they are seeing that there's a lot more to donald trump than 	the media led them to believe. and look  this is important. nafta has to be negotiated because  you know  we are 450 million people in this market. we are 28% of the world's gdp. this is important stuff. the president is paying attention to -- ed: wait. the media said everything is going to fall apart if you re renegotiated nafta. they were saying it's a disaster disaster. you're saying it's reopened dialogue? >> it's increased exports by the agricultural industry by 350%. it is phenomenal. created 40 million jobs  25 million of which are here in the -- ed: daniel garcia  we're glad that we stole rachel away from you. thanks for coming in. >> it's a pleasure. rachel: president trump blasting the media  saying they refused to cover his rising poll numbers numbers. is he right? we'll ask corey lewandowski next next. todd: and nancy pelosi has called those bonuses handed out to americans after the trump tax cut ""crumbs."" now more americans get a bump in their paycheck  so how much can","","","","",""

[ both smooch ] ciao bella. 	>> a little bit of sweet revenge in it for me and certainly probably the family in the sense that if they wouldn't have done this this stuff wouldn't be going on. this would be going on at the highest levels of government. 	they'd be continuing to do it to my father  trying to undermine his actions. imagine how effective he could be given the year he's had without this cloud over his hea. ed: that was donald trump jr. you saw him there with jesse watters jumping in on this republican memo released by devin nunes on friday. we want to get the perspective of corey lewandowski  the former can you review campaign manager  coauthor of ""let me trump be trump."" good morning  corey. >> good morn.ng ed: what do you think we heard the sky was going to fall if this memo came out  then we heard  well  it's not a big deal actually because it's going to be a dud  then it actually comes out and the president says  ""i'm vindicated."" well  the president's absolutely right. and what we saw was that members of the deep state were very concerned about putting out information that they knew that they were wrong about. and look. what i'm talking about is members of the f.b.i. who took information that was obtained through a dossier paid for by the clinton campaign and michael steele -- christopher steele 	presented to a judge in a fisa court and asked them to continue surveillance on an american citizen on u.s. soil without disclosing where the information came from. this is one of the grossest abuses of power that we've seen from a government agency  and there has to be accountability. what the president has said is completely right. it has shown once again  no collusion  no cooperation  no coordination between trump  the trump campaign  and any outside entity  which is what this was supposed to be. and the f.b.i. and the people who applied for this application need to held accountable. ed: so corey  if you're right and this was a corrupt bargain by the f.b.i. and the justice department to get donald trump but there's no collusion and there's no crime there and it really was nothing  sort of all a setup based on a lie from the dossier  why did general flynn lie to the f.b.i.  and why does it appear that people in the president's inner circle lied at least to the new york times if not investigators about that trump tower meeting in 2016? why not just tell the truth? >> look. i think anybody who's questioned by the f.b.i. should tell the truth. and  you know  if general flynn 	didn't tell the truth  which is what happened  and now he's pled to a felony  you know  he needs to be accountable for that. but let's go back and look at hillary clinton. you know  cheryl mills  huma abedin  they have never been under oath  in accountability for that. what we do know unequivocally is this: only one campaign in the last election cycle paid for a dossier with a former spy to go to russia  and then they took that information and used it to spy on american citizens in u.s. soil. this is one of the grossest abuses of the fourth amendment we've seen. rachel: a lot of people are saying the answer to all of this is a radical transparency. are you going to recommend to the president that he release even more documents  maybe some of the transcripts from those interviews to show whether or not there was bias or at least that hillary and huma and all those figures were treated differently? how much transparency should we get? >> look. 	we need to have as much transparency in this case as possible pin that some of the media has asked for jim comey's contemporaneous needs to be released. jim comey takes contemporaneous notes  he then releases them to his law professor to make sure they end up in the media and that's okay  and there's been no accountability for jim comey. you can't have it both ways  lying jim. either you release on the information to the public  you don't give select information to your law professor so it gets in the media. that's where the american people are have we concept elk. james comey has lied to congress and needs to be held accountabl. todd: with regard to accountability  is it time for rod rosenstein to go? >> well  that's a question that the president and attorney general sessions have to decide. i know that rod rosenstein  according to this memorandum  his name is on at least signing off on the application for the fisa warrant  based on on the false dossier. 	that should give people in the justice department grave concern that the credibility of the information that they had and presented to the fisa court was not accurate. and rod needs to answer for those questi.ns ed: how do we do that? do we expect hearings before the house intelligence committee? because the bottom line here is that you just called james comey ""lying jim."" that was an appointee of president obama but as you know  rod rosenstein was nominated by president trump. how frustrating is it to you as a trump insider that somebody nominated by this president helped sign off on the fisa warrant? >> well  it's very concerning. it's not just because he's appointed by trump. it's concerning that he signed off on an application to spy on a u.s. citizen on domestic soil on a false dossier and a false premise. and if that's the type -- look. the f.b.i. is one of the greatest law enforcement agencies that we've ever had  and i respect the people that work in the department of justice. but if this is the type research they're do and presenting to a 	federal judge to ask for the opportunity to spy on a u.s. citizen  we should have some real grave concerns  because it's not about one person  about a larger narrative. are they spying on me and you with a false dossier? is clinton funding any other information that they're using to spy on american citizens? if so  that's a real problem and those people need to be held accountable for it. rachel: thank you  corey  you're right  we need to restore trust in our institutions. we got to leave it there. thank you for joining us this morning. turning now to your headlines 3. terrifying moments caught on dash cam as a man lunges off his car  attacking a police officer with a knife. >> stop! get down now! stay right there! stop or i'll shoot you! rachel: the suspect  brett bush  leading the georgia officer on a high speed chase after attempting to pull him over for speeding. the 28 year old crashing into a georgia driveway before being shot and killed by the unidentified officer. the cop  who was also a marine veteran  is not injured. 	at least nine states now considering new laws requiring residents to buy health insurance. the proposal coming less than two months after republicans voted to repeal the individual mandate in obama-backed affordable care act. according to that act  people should not be forced to pay for coverage. some of those states include maryland  california  and new jersey  according to the wall street journal. todd: and eight players elected to the pro football hall of fame modern era stars  randy moss  terrell owens  ray lewis  bob you are lacquer  robert brazil  and jerry cramer of vikings fame up there in minnesota this weekend. they'll be enshrined in canton  ohio  this summer. in the meantime  there's a little game  patriots quarterback tom brady is involved in that game  named the nfl's most valuable player. can you believe it's only his 	third award?

head towards the midterms. wages are rising at the fastest pace in many  many years. bonuses  316 companies are giving these bonuses  and that's just big companies. three million people are getting them. best buy just joined the list  giving a thousand bucks to a hundred thousand full time employees. your pension plan's looking a whole lot of better. your paychecks went up this month. 	there are 127 million paychecks  full-time jobs in america. roughly 110 million got an increase in their paycheck. so if you're looking at the economy  and you're looking at the election  you got to say that things are going in the republicans' favor. and  by the way  the president's approval rating just hit almost 42%. now  that's low  but it's much better than it's ever been over it is past year. rachel: certainly those comments from nancy pelosi calling -- where i live  stewart  when you have an extra thousand dollars at the end of the year they call it christmas. >> yes. can i just break in for one second to get this in. rachel: yes. >> three times nancy pelosi has said 86 million middle class american families will pay more with this tax bill. that is utter nonsense. that's malicious spin at the very best. debbie wasserman schultz  she said precisely  ""i'm not sure that a thousand dollars goes very few for anyone."" how out of touch can you get? 	if the democrats go into the midterms with that as their leadership spouting utter economic nonsense  i think the republicans got a decent cha.ce ed: quickly  stuart  in the time we have remaining  the situation on friday  where the market absolutely tanked on good news. explain why that had happened. rob:. >> good news  like i just said  the economy is really moving forward. that means interest rates goes up. when interest rates go up  you can get a nice return on a bond. so some people who have done very well in the stock market  might want to sell a little bit of their stock  sell some of it  put into a bond which is very secure  treasury bond  nearly 3% you sleep well at night  you get your 3%  you get a tax break on the interest on you might sell a little stock. rachel: free advice from stuart varney. ed: coming up  counselor to the president kellyanne conway will be joining us live. rachel: plus pete is live in minneapolis gearing up for the 	super bowl. he's joined by minnesota's comeback story of the year. vikings quarterback case keenum  his story next. before i had the shooting  burning of diabetic nerve pain these feet... liked to style my dog as a kid... and were pumped to open my own salon. but i couldn't bear my diabetic nerve pain any longer. so i talked to my doctor and she prescribed lyrica. lyrica may cause serious allergic reactions  suicidal thoughts or actions. tell your doctor right away if you have these  new or worse depression  unusual changes in mood or behavior  swelling  trouble breathing  rash  hives  blisters  muscle pain with fever  tired feeling or blurry vision. common side effects: dizziness  sleepiness  weight gain  swelling of hands  legs  and feet. don't drink alcohol while taking lyrica. don't drive or use machinery until you know how lyrica affects you. those who have had a drug or alcohol problem may be more likely to misuse lyrica. now i have less diabetic nerve pain. ask your doctor about lyrica. 	>> everyone loves a good comeback story. the minnesota vikings had one this year with our quarterback  case keenum  who led the vikings on an unbelievable finish in the divisional game before a very tough lost last week. case is with pete hegseth in minnesota. pete  take it away. >> hey  guys  can you believe it it? i'm here with minnesota vikings quarterback case keenum  an amazing season  such an honor. you know i'm a super fan  so just to be here means a lot. an amazing year  an amazing year for you personally too. you've been with a few different teams  	you came in in week 2 as a backup  expectations maybe not very high and you delivered all the way through. how did you step into that role and embrace it? >> i appreciate that  pete. it means a lot. you know  for me it's been a lot of hard work  a lot of years of hard work  a lot of trusting in god's plan. we've obviously bounced around  originally from texas by way of the texans  with the rams  made the move from st. louis to l.a. and now up here in beautiful minneapolis. >> kind of you to call this beautiful. >> it's beautiful and on its way way. we loved our journey and it's definitely been a journey. you know  god's taken us a lot of different places  but  you know  this year what we experienced with this city  vikings fans everywhere  it's pretty awesome. >> part of the ""pretty awesome"" was the minnesota miracle  the throw with 14 seconds left to send the vikings to the nfc championship game. 	when you let the ball go  did you think you had a chance or was this  hey  i've got one of my best receivers  hope he makes the play? >> you know  before the play  looked at the everybody in the huddling and said i'm going to give one of you a chance. that's all diggsy needed. at that point fourth quarter we played a really hard fought against against a really good team  the new orleans saints. you're not really thinking much. you're reacting and playing. when i let the ball go i knew he had a chance to catch it. when he jumped up and i see  you know  his white gloves going up for the catch  you knew he had chamber of commerce to catch it. when he came down i thought he was going to get out of bounds and i'm glad he didn't. >> you and me both. you say there's unfinished business. obvious the nfc championship didn't go the way we wanted. do you feel like we'll see case keenum in purple next year? >> i don't know. i can't tell the future. you know  i love this team  i love this city. i love playing in this stadium. you know  and  yeah  there's the 	whole team feels like there's some unfished business  some meat left on the bone. like i said  i would love to play with these guys  but  you know  the nature of the business side of this game is that you have to make tough decisions. >> we only have 15 seconds but faith plays a big role in who you are. tell us about that? >> yeah  it's a huge part for me and my wife. god has been instrumental in everywhere we've been  he's had an incredible plan for me and my wife and  you know  i couldn't be more happy with where we wound up here  just continue to trust in him. >> met your wife at photocopy of christian athletes. my dad used to lead a huddle of that as well. it's a great way for athletes to get connected to their faith. i hope to see you here next year year. i'm being selfish. an amazing guy  a texan who's getting used to minnesota and 20 degrees below here trooper. thanks. rachel: seems like a really nice guy . ed: from one minneapolis miracle to near. pete hegseth  that was his nickname. rachel: coming up  sara carter  	counselor to the president kellyanne

others injured after an amtrak train collides with a freight train in south carolina. 139 passengers eight crew members on board. teams responding to the scene as quickly as possible. volunteers are coming from across the state to assist with this effort. the 70 injuries range obviously in variety we have anything from small scratches and bumps to more severe broken bones. >> the decision by the white house and senator nunes to release that now declassified memo is drawing fierce reaction. >> congressman nunes says his committee is moving on to phase ii. >> devon nunes will come out with more reports. 	>> donald trump didn't create this mess but he's here to help clean it up. >> democrats will push to release their own 10 page memo next week. >> it's appalling. it's a misrepresentation. it's a release of a distortion. she also said the tax cut was armageddon. >> they would rather see america fail than succeed with donald trump at the helm. ed: if just waking up on a sunday morning two people are dead 70 injured in a south carolina train derailment brand new video as light comes up here showing mangled train cars some even tipped over as an amtrak train collides with a freight train. todd: the crash happening in the middle of the night in the city of casey just outside columbia. ntsb chairman calling in earlier to fox & friends with the next step in handling this horrible tragedy. >> i suspect that we will have some preliminary information by this afternoon from a number of data sources  to be able to pin 	down the speed of the amtrak train at the point of the collision  so that's our priority. rachel: we are live following the latest  brian? reporter: well the ntsb go team is en route from washington d.c. these are the first boots on the ground so to speak investigators to arrive at any major accident such as this. this all started at 2:35 this morning was when both trains collided. amtrak train 91 from new york to miami collided with a csx freight train. what you're looking at right now are photos from the red cross at pine ridge middle school which is where many survivors and victims were taken to at a shelter remember it's 38 degrees outside and raining and these folks went through a very traumatic experience being taken care of at the local shelter. this is video from the scene this morning. governor henry mcmaster is set to speak to the media at 9:30. there are two dead and at least 70 injured. hospitals in the area say 	lexington medical center says they received 25 patients with minor injury  palmetto health says she received 62 patients some with two children. this is what the scene was like when first responders arrived at the scene this morning. >> what we found was two different trains passenger train and a freight train that collided. what we immediately went into was a search mode  search and rescue mode. we are able to begin to extract and assist passengers off of that train. at this time  all passengers are off of the train. that is very important to put out there. reporter: that is very important to point out you have eight crew members that were on that train  139 passengers  everyone has been taken off the train. important because that means that  you know  there aren't people that are mangled or have serious issues that are still on scene so everyone is being treated in hospitals  again these injuries range from scratches to severe broken bones no reports of anybody necessarily in critical condition  so back to you guys. 	ed: brian thanks for staying on top of the story. in the meantime the story that's been dominating the weekend of course is that republican memo that started out as hashtag release the memo and then hashtag help o day and now it's hashtag vindication if you listen to the president. todd: one way the president communicates with all of us is the tweet. the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa influenced the 2016 election and its aftermath. the fbi failed to inform the fisa court the clinton campaign had funded the dossier about fbi became a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and not to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a non-partisan enforcer of the law the fbi wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators and cites the wall street journal. todd: what's interesting is this is just phase i. devon nunes has an interview on 	friday on special report and everyone thought this is it. this is part one  state department is next. you heard jason chaffetz earlier on the show saying they are digging into the intelligence community saying this was going to damage national security and then the memo comes out there does not appear to be any damage to national security so devon nunes is going to keep pushing and he's the person who we wouldn't know anything about fusion gps and the hillary clinton campaign paying for the dossier without him demanding those bank reports. rachel: he's had to fight tooth and nail against members of congress who should care about transparency and ethics and the fbi and doj. after all they have oversight over those agencies. really pushing back against that   we wouldn't know at all that the dossier was paid for by the dnc. ed: more coming from nunes but also more from the department of justice inspector general putting out this report and a little earlier jason chaffetz laid it all out. >> donald trump didn't create this mess but he is here to help 	clean it up. anybody who reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system and  you know all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats that this was an attack on law enforcement  this is going to dismantle our security apparatus   this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true. none of it. todd: bottom line is that report from the inspector general some said it might be months away i've been hearing in washington weeks away so more is coming. ed: if you woke up this morning to decide you're reading papers  a completely different view of the world. the view being put out there is donald trump is going to attack our fbi and our law enforcement. let's take a look at headlines from the new york times or as pete likes to say the failing new york times. trump's unparalleled war on a pillar of society law enforcement. this one comes from politico trump escalates his war with u.s. law enforcement after memo 	release. washington post once the party of law and order republicans are now challenging it and so you could hear the three of us talk about this and give our opinions on it. i've told you what mine is i go to these diners and talk to people including law enforcement and they love this president but ed and i have the good fortune to sit down with an fbi agent and we asked him directly  what do you think. ed: he had a surprise. he went after james comey and said the leadership is a problem but had a little surprise about andrew mccabe. >> those of us in the retired agent community we're hearing that director deputy director money cake was expressing his conditions in closed door meetings all the time about trump so we're talking about a pre-determined investigation and that is just not how the fbi as a whole operates. the problem is agents on the street don't operate that way. todd: interesting andrew mccabe ousted this past week as deputy director. his wife in 2015 was running for the state senate in virginia with money from the buddy of the 	clintons that has been aired. he waited until the very last minute to recuse himself in the hillary clinton investigation was overseeing it even though his wife had gotten money. okay fast forward the text messages  strzok and page. the insurance policy was about if donald trump gets elected there's a meeting in andy's office we believe that to be andrew mccabe and now we're hearing from a former retired fbi agent that in fact mccabe he's hearing was out in private meetings giving his opinion saying he didn't like donald trump what in the world was going on? rachel: it's interesting you said the democrats said the republican party used to be the party of law and order and the democrat used to be the party of jfk. i think what we're seeing is this is officially the party of bernie sanders  socialists don't care about individual rights all the individual rights that have been violated through the unmask ing and the spying on the lack of transparency in the upper departments  this is a party a socialistic party who cares about the state  the collective. not individual rights and that's 	why if you're wondering why democrats and the media which is one in the same are not concerned about all this that's your answer in my opinion. ed: we've got a lot of other headlines this morning. rachel: turning to your headlines now. terrifying moments caught on camera  when a police officer is run over by a carjacking suspect while making an arrest. police storming the vehicle before the driver backs over the two. the suspect flees running them over again. a plain-clothes officer had a gun drawn on the suspects but did not fire. policy prohibits san francisco police from shooting at cars their union says it puts officer s lives in danger. the suspects were arrested and the officer is expected to be okay. christian broadcasting network founder pat robertson recovering after suffering from a stroke. a family member rushing the 87 year old to a hospital in virginia after recognizing symptoms. robertson hosts the flagship show the 700 club  and interview ed president trump during his campaign and after 	the election. he is expected to make a full recovery. president trump and the first lady are hosting a super bowl party. wow i wish i was invited. [laughter] at mar-a-lago  the first family will hold the festivities before traveling back to washington. the president has a friendly relationship with the new england patriots especially the owner robert craft and quarterback tom brady. todd: speaking of the big game our own pete hegseth is live in his home state of minnesota for super bowl lii. pete you still look cold. it hasn't warmed up that much. pete: holy cow it's only getting colder it's negative 22 is what it feels like right now so i can barely feel my face  but we'll go with it. we're outside the stadium where it will be rocking tonight when the philadelphia eagles take on new england patriots but there's no way to sugar coat that this has been a difficult year for the nfl. the kneeling controversy  the anthem controversy  and we've seen the ratings drop significantly. there's actually a wall street journal nbc news poll that came out just yesterday that said 	that viewership is down this year substantially from two  three  four years ago so i went to the mall of america which is just a hop  skip and a jump from here yesterday to talk to fans of the nfl and say did the kneeling controversy affect you  are you watching more  are you watching less? this is what the fans had to say about the nfl this year. >> i watched just as much as i did before. pete: so none of the controversy around the nfl anthem protest and things like that affected you? >> no not at all. actually i respect their decision. we wish they would stand up. we love our country. we want them to do it. stand up. they make millions of dollars in this country. they couldn't go anywhere else and do it so stand up and honor our flag. >> i was in the service for 23 years  yeah it affects me personally  sometimes i had to shut the game off. i can't even watch it any more. pete: you know guys  bottom line   fans want politics out of sports. a lot of people said i still 	watch but i watch reluctantly but the ratings reflect there's plenty of people that have turned off the dial. no doubt the nfl this off season will have to address what they do with patriotism and the anthem because viewership is down substantially. rachel: well maybe that's what they're doing with all of the veterans they are having on the show you've been interviewing? pete: well that's true. they're donating the veterans project having veterans on the field. some people feel like that's window dressing at the end of a tough season. what they really do next year will affect how a lot of people view the league. ed: he's got kellyanne conway coming in live from the super bowl we'll go back to pete. pete: coming in cold  soon. ed: thanks so much pete we'll see you soon. rachel: thanks pete stay warm. todd: how ins devon nunes says there are more memos coming we've been talking about that all morning long and the next one could target the state department so what do we know about this memo? sarah carter has been on top of the story from the very beginning she's been digging into this specifically and joins us live  next. 	>> ♪ ♪ when you combine ancestry's dna test with its historical records... ...you could learn you're from ireland... ...donegal  ireland... ...and your ancestor was a fisherman. with blue eyes. just like you. begin your journey at ancestry.com he gets the best deal on the perfect hotel by using. tripadvisor! that's because tripadvisor lets you start your trip on the right foot... by comparing prices from over 200 booking sites to find the right hotel for you at the lowest price. 	saving you up to 30%! you'll be bathing in savings! tripadvisor. check the latest reviews and lowest prices. a little to the left. 1  2  3  push! easy! easy! easy!

>> i think you're right on the mark there  ed. look  they came out not just ker ry  but we saw  you know  care ic holder  we saw many other members of the obama administration cop out and say this is going to destroy national security we don't want this out  director comey was another one  former fbi director comey and what we discovered was there was nothing in there and i've spoken to a number of u.s. intelligence sources about this. there was nothing in that memo at all that would have damaged national security of the united states  or the processes by which they gather the fisa warrants  right? 	or the application so now we have to ask ourselves why and i believe your right. this is due to the second memo that the intelligence committee is putting together and we're sit waiting for the inspector general's report coming out that's directed at andrew mccabe   deputy  you know now former deputy director andrew mccabe and others and i think they're terrified because this is what we know. there was a second dossier put together by a person named cody shear. a very controversial activist a former reporter who worked with the clintons in the past and the fbi was also using the second dossier as part of what they were doing to back up the other dossier that christopher steele unverified dossier. another thing that's important is we believe and i've been talking to sources that christopher steele was also sending information to the state department in bits and snip-ins but i think the most important thing here and one of the things they're looking at very closely 	are the leaks. there were a number of leaks of unverified information by possibly senior members of the obama administration. ed: i want to bring rachel in as well but you said something about a second dossier and i've heard rumblings of that but i'm not sure if viewers have heard too much about it so briefly we can get rachel in here as well is this a second anti-trump dossier what do we know? >> okay this is what we know here. there is a second anti-trump dossier that i have been able to confirm. that was written by cody shear. now he is not an expert and has no background in intelligence. he is a former reporter and political hack ski vest and also had a close relationship with cindy blumenthal  and remember i wrote a piece about it how cindy blumenthal would be connected to the dossier in one fashion or another and those are the bits of information as we unravel this great mystery of the dossier those are the little 	bits of information that we have out there. now the house intelligence committee and others who are investigating this like senator grassley we don't want to takeaway from senator grassley because senator grassley's letter and his exposure of christopher steele and asking for everybody's communications  if you look at senator grassley 's letter he's asked the doj for all the communication of cody shear  of cindy blumenthal  of christopher steele. those are little pieces of this puzzle that we're putting together and as we've seen  they're kicking and screaming. they don't want this information out into the public and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they were involved in using this dossier to leak information. rachel: so sarah  it sounds like what you're saying is that it's maybe we're going to go talk about not the russians but all of the collusion happening in these investigations. ed: yeah. rachel: i don't have another question you answered all of them so thank you. >> thanks. ed: all right the marines are doing something they haven't done in 30 years running a super 	bowl ad  their goal get younger fans. the head of recruiting joins us live to talk about that  next. so a few years ago  me and my wife were actually saving for a house. but one day we were sitting there and we decided that  you know what?

>> we're trying to have a conversation with young people that are seeking challenges in life and what you're seeing is a 	culmination of an ad campaign that appeals to men and women across this country that have fought through battles throughout their high school careers and they seek to further that by joining the service and serving their country. todd: looking at the calendar  i understand that february through may is a really tough time to recruit. why is that? >> well typically when a young person becomes a senior in high school  they're eligible to en list in one of the services and so most of those contracts get written in the summer months and into the first few months of the school year  the new school year   so by the time february rolls around  you've probably written most of those kids signed them up for service and now what we're doing is mostly writing kids that have graduated high school  are seeking something else in their life  and it's a little bit tougher in those months. todd: and tell us  i mean everyone gets around the table gets around the tv set  gets 	around their iphone now to watch the big game. what message do you want to send to americans  when we still have so many troops in harms way all around the world. >> look  young people today are faced with a multitude of pressures. the battle that they fight just getting through high school  staying out of trouble  getting good grades they might be working a job to help support their family. by the time they're finished they may want to continue to seek those challenges and so 38 000 young people signed up last year to join the marines and for that very purpose. rachel: well you've chosen  you're saving the marine corps a lot of money by doing this online and not an actual television ad. you called these young people cord cutters what do you mean by that? >> well  increasingly young people are getting their news and information and entertainment from means other than television  broadcast television so they're getting it on handheld devices and tablets 	and watching it when they want to watch it and so we thought it was smart and it was effective cost effective to reach out during the super bowl this year to about 20 million people that mostly younger people under 30 that will take in our ad and message. we'll have a conversation with them tonight. todd: major general paul kennedy we appreciate your service we thank you for that all of the men and women serving with you and we hope that you bring in a few good men and women art super bowl. >> thank you  sir. rachel: still ahead  president trump heading to ohio tomorrow after a super bowl party in florida tonight  so watt can we expect from this trip?

please. real people with active psoriatic arthritis are changing the way they fight it... they're moving forward with cosentyx®. it's a different kind of targeted biologic. it's proven to help people find less joint pain and clearer skin. don't use if you are allergic to cosentyx. 	before starting cosentyx you should be checked for tuberculosis. an increased risk of infections and lowered ability to fight them may occur. tell your doctor if you have an infection or symptoms of an infection. or if you have received a vaccine  or plan to. if you have inflammatory bowel disease tell your doctor if symptoms develop or worsen. serious allergic reactions may occur. with less joint pain  watch me. for less joint pain and clearer skin  ask your rheumatologist about cosentyx. ed: to prove to you that fox news is fair and balanced earlier in the program we had patriots super fan on  silent. todd: as he pointed out. ed: about his patriots. todd: we didn't ask him. ed: we did not. pete hegseth an eagles superfan kellyanne conway guys take it away. 	pete: boy that's right thanks for sending it to us you're exactly right. we just came into the eagles fight song  fly eagles fly  which i know you love. thanks so much for being here kellyanne conway. >> we have the parade later on in philly this week. pete: see that's the prediction. do you have a score prediction for tonight? >> no just that the eagles will score more points than the patriots. pete: we're setting a record this is the coldest interview with the counselors of the president ever. >> i can confirm that that is true and probably the first or second one in eagles gear but we're really excited. it's a great day here with my husband and our two older children and the last time the eagles were in the super bowl was against the patriots and our twins were three months old and they're now 13. we hope for a different result this time. pete: i know you hope for a different result. have you ever been inside the stadium? >> i have not. i know it's beautiful we watched an incredible photo finish of the vikings game when they made it to the nfc championship. i think we'll appreciate it when we're inside the stadium but 	looking for a big win today. pete: it will be a 90-degree change it's negative 20 out here it will be 72 in there  so you'll be -- >> a fun way of looking at it. pete: so we've got to get to politics of the day as well. obviously devon nunes his committee releasing the memo with so many people wanted to see. first of all your reaction to the contents of that four-page memo and what it says about what was happening at the doj and the fbi. >> well the president has always called for transparency and accountability  pete. that's what he believes all along those who have been talking about collusion collusion collusion with no result for over a year should really appreciate the process of transparency and accountability even when it hits a little close to home in this case  i believe that mr. mccabe testified that without that dossier  there would be no fisa warrant  and people are realizing too that dossier is just a fancy french word for a load of junk and but the president is absolutely right and i think tweeted again yesterday what he's said all along which is this is just a hoax. 	we were promised collusion and we're moving on to other charges but in my position  i'm not the president's personal attorney. i would defer your questions to them but in terms of releasing the memo people were screaming about national security concerns and the whole world is going to fall apart. i think people are afraid they look really bad. there are personal relationships in there  marital relationships  whose working at fusion gps  christopher steele has admitted that he was desperate to make sure donald trump didn't get elected so people should at least see that and see the bias for what it is. pete: talk to me more about that reaction from democrats and so-called mainstream media saying they're national security inly indications to this release how disingenuinous do you find it  why won't they look at it as a possible exposure of the fact that maybe there was bias? >> i find it to be hyperbolic and very hypocritical because they've been charging forward for over one year now  promising 	collusion  promising a change in the election results and nullification of a democrat if elected president. that's just not happening and i know they're still trying to get over an election result they neither expected nor wanted but that's too bad and this whole idea that we're only supposed to investigate one piece and not the other is really wrong and i hear these people saying this is unprecedented and you really are hurting the relationship with the doj and the fbi. the president made very clear and i'll say it again yet again  he respects the rankin file and the great hard work these men and women do every day as part of the fbi and those in the doj as well  but that doesn't mean that a couple of the bad apples out there who were just starting to see had nefarious intentions and were desperate to try to at least affect the outcome or after president trump was elected to mess with him during transition. pete: well we're hearing more will come out and it could come out additional memos and when they do we'll ask you about that 	as well. >> i support that as well in other words if the schiff memo comes forward then go ahead. we're for transparency but look you can't argue this not under oath through the cable tv wars and that's what's happening. people are going on saying things that are simply not true hoping they will come true. pete: well this president spark a national debate when he talked about kneelers? we're here at the nfl and there's no way to scoot around it. it was a tough year at the nfl for those who leave you stand for the national anthem a big national debate. what's your takeaway you'll cheer for your team in the super bowl today but the nfl learned a lot of lessons this year what's your takeaway from the stance the president took about standing for the anthem? >> the president is unlike any other american citizen. he can stand up for the flag and express that he's got a big mega phone of course in my house and many households across the country you say you take a knee for the lord and stand for the flag. i think that we don't have any kneelers today we'll see what happens. i thought my philadelphia eagles 	handled well from the very beginning they had huge field- wide flag and wonderful man singing the national anthem including the nfc championship african american veteran and i think that was very uplifting to those who love the flag and believe in it  but also i think when you look at the grammies  the emmys all of the ratings are down because people look at sports  you look at entertainment and these award shows as an escape. they don't try and run for politics and don't want to hear negative necessarily all day long. i know it's easy to take a cheap shot but to what end? it's not  it doesn't really fit with these award shows and the themes they're supposed to have so i think here people are all about the great tradition of the super bowl and it ends up being a worldwide event . lots of great fans out there  eagles fans are excited ran into patriots fans but it should be a 	great game and one of the greatest american traditions and enjoy themselves eat a little bit too much and cheer the big green on to victory. pete: we heard that just keep the politics out of it is what you heard time and time again. well guys i'll toss it back to you but let me say  kellyanne conway can play in the cold. rachel: she looks less cold than you. >> i'm definitely the summer parent at home but i thought i'd do this on a special day. pete: champion thank you. tossing it back to new york. rachel: great interview. ed: good stuff. rachel: turning to your headlines now. terrifying moments caught on a dashcam as a man lunges off his car attacking a police officer with a knife. >> stop  get out  now! stay right there. stop or i'll shoot you. rachel: the suspect brett bush leading the georgia officer on a high speed chase after attempting pull him over for speeding. the 28 year old crashing into a georgia driveway before being 	shot and killed. the cop whose also a marine veteran is not injured. and an elementary school canceling its father-daughter dance due to new gender rules. parents and students are furious with the staten island new york school fighting a state mandate to eliminate gender-based activities. if school officials are telling the new york post ""father- daughter dances inherent ly leave people out  not just because of transgender status  just life in general. these can be really uncomfortable events."" the school's pta is planning to reschedule the dance for kids and caregivers of any gender for march 2. thousands of dollars worth of jewelry stolen from the pregnant fiancee of actor john stamos on the eve of their wedding. actress indicate rib mccue were not in their upscale beverly hotel room. the pieces were reportedly on 	loan. no surveillanceses have been identified. the wedding went on as planned and the hollywood couple tying the knot. ed: have mercy. rachel: beautiful company and today is world cancer day  raising awareness of the global fight against this disease and it also honors survivors and advances in treatments being made every single day. nearly 9 million people die from cancer worldwide every year. the theme of today is ""we can  i can."" the campaign encourages everyone to do their part to help end the disease. this is a look at all of the cancer-fighting events happening around the world right now  including fundraisers and screenings and those are your headlines guys. ed: great cause. all right  meanwhile the stock market preparing for another big week. the dow plunged 600 points on friday  what could we expect at the opening bell  no one breaks it down better maria bartiromo here next. todd: plus we're just hours away from kickoff csx freight and so we've got last-minute menu ideas for your super bowl party all that coming up when fox and 	friends on a sunday returns. sometimes a cough gets in the way of a good night's sleep. that's when he needs vicks vaporub. proven cough medicine. with 8 hours of vapors. so he can sleep. vicks vaporub. goodnight coughs. the center of the how canneighborhood?r house first  mix liquid gold velveeta with the one-two kick of ro*tel's diced tomatoes and spicy green chilies. then  find space for extra parking. lots and lots of parking. 	ed: tomorrow like just about every weekday morning the stock market reopening for the first time following friday's sharp sell off the dow tumbling 665 points the worst drop in more than a year of course the big picture is its been going up up up. rich what can we expect for the markets this week here to break it all down sunday morning futures host maria bartiromo. welcome. maria: hi guys great to see you. maria: good to see you. rachel: so the question is we saw this sell off in the market but you say it's for all of the good reasons. maria: it is  i mean look there's still broad support for this market because the impact of the tax plan hasn't really been felt entirely yet. right now it's just anticipation we also haven't seen the full impact of the regulatory rollback so there's a real support for this market because the underlying fundamentals are 	very strong. friday we got a jobs number out 200 000 jobs created in the month of january and also the atlanta federal reserve coming out with a new prediction on economic growth  they've got a gaap number for the first quarter which we're in of 5.4%. ed: are you actually trying to make the case that crumbs will equal real bread for people? maria: my god 100% this tax plan is going far and deep there's a really big impact felt from on individuals as well as corporations and that will continue to help economic growth so i think that markets don't go up in a straight line forever. we've had an incredible performance $8 trillion in market value since the election. of course you are going to see markets go up and down and now that we're talking about a different scenario  we have a new conversation happening right now. it's about higher wages and inflation these are the things that happen with a stronger economy. that wage number on friday was very strong up 2.9% year-over-year we're finally see ing individual wages go up and that's why markets have been 	nervous. todd: but i think it could be confusing to the average american who doesn't necessarily fully understand economics why we could have an amazing jobs growth number and then we see a market tank basically almost 700 points. explain how it all comes back to interest rates. maria: yeah because when you're investing you have to make a decision do i want to take on a little more risk and look for a higher return and go into the stock market or do i want to stay with the safety of treasur ies where you know you've got the full back of the country of the treasury and look for a higher interest rate. once interest rates start going higher then you have a debate. well do i want to stay safe and go into the bond market and see interest rates go higher or do i want to stay in stocks and dole with a little more risk? ed: and bond buyers have been desperate for any high interest rate. maria: it's a good thing for savers because in your savings account your rates are going to go higher. rachel: really fast because people ask this all the time. when people say this is obama's economy really fast what's your 	answer? maria: no when the president changed everything  when he took office it was largely about the regulatory environment that's why you can't really attribute this to president obama because president obama had so many rules and regulations red tape 95 000 pages was the federal registry donald trump came in and knocked all of that down and lowered regulations that removed the red tape and as a result it has unleashed animal spirits. ed: sunday morning futures will be unleashed at the top of the hour. maria: we've got jim kallstrom former assistant director of the fbi  we've got congressman rad cliff  one of the only three congressmen who actually have seen the underlying data  the underlying content of the fisa memo  we have alan dershowitz and peter king and about that stock market and economy  on financial services. rachel: a great show. super star. todd: great job. rachel: the countdown  thank you maria you're the best. the countdown to kickoff is on  rick is checking out some super bowl snack ideas for your party  	next. >> ♪ ♪ drive. it's fine. because i get a safe driving bonus check every six months i'm accident free. and i don't share it with mom! right  mom?

avoid a second government shutdown. kevin kelly with the latest proposals to keep the door open. kelly: the white house says the president is traveling to ohio today where he will tout his federal

march 22nd  democrats want to resolve the immigration issue involving daca  deferred action for childhood arrivals  let to two-day shutdown. democratic durbin wants to avoid shutdown but pushing for bipartisan deal on daca. >> there's not likely to be a daca deal though we are working every single day on telephone calls and person to person to reach try to reach this bipartisan agreement. i do

us  appreciate it. despite criticism from conservative republicans former white house chief of staff 	reince priebus defending to offer path of citizenship for nearly 2 million dreamers  not only does it force democrats to make the next move but it's the president's way of calling bluff on daca. >> i think that if you look at what's happening in the economy  you look at tax cuts an unemployment  i think those things matter a lot. i actually thing he is doing better  he did better with black voters and hispanic voters in the election  i think we can do more. i think the president's position that he's taking on the dreamers and daca is very bold  i think he's boxed the democrats in on that issue  i think it'll be very difficult for them to walk away from. he's giving more than i probably would have given in the same advice to him but i also think it's clever of him to offer far more on daca than what most republicans would have offered because i think it boxes 	everyone else in. i think it's very smart. heather: another news the federal reserve officially getting a new chief today  jar ohm powell will be sworn in at 9:00 a.m. inheriting a historically booming economy. powell

the ranking file at the fbi and the doj read this tweet carefully  read it again as the fisa memo fallout continues. but according to the media the president's call for transparency is more like a call to arms against law enforcement  some of the headlines there. here to weigh in former nypd lieutenant darren  thank you so much for joining us. >> thanks for having me  heather. heather: what about this  is the release antilaw enforcement? >> no  it's not. you to take into consideration what it is. when you look at three components of government  executive branch in particular that's at the forefront of law 	enforcement and that's what trump represents  when you look at the campaign  he was adamant supporter of law enforcement  so in terms of the transparency with this memo  i think it was sound and it was necessary  this fisa memo came out and it showed that  look  trump didn't do anything wrong  so moving forward he railed against the -- i want to say the acts of the justice department in connection with this and proves a sound piece that trump did what was necessary and he wasn't a part of this russian collusion. so when you hear things  him railing against the fbi  they overstepped boundaries. heather: its leaders at the top of the fbi and the top of the doj  it's not the ranking file  the ranking file i should say and the men and women that go out and do the job every single day. let's look at the post from the washington post  open defiance of release of hot disputed memo 	revealed how gop  has become adversary of law enforcement as continuing quest to defend president trump from russia investigation. >> you know  i disagree. i'm a strong proponent of the president and the position he's taking moving forward. one of the things that president trump did that was very necessary was the firing of james comey. i think that he was in play when a lot of the oversteps by the fisa memo were taken place and so he came in  trump rightfully so came in and got rid of them  a lot of people saying that rod rosenstein is being villainized. this is a strong comparison where he's been and goes back to his support  advert support for law enforcement. 	heather: they are supposed to decide today whether to release the democratic memo to the fisa memo that's been released. transparency in and of itself of itself  does transparency make the fbi and the doj weaker in their ability to do their job because that's what this was  it was making them transparent? >> i think transparency is necessary entity not just law enforcement but politics in general and this is something that trump has introduced at the forefront  look  i want to get this out to the american people  i want them to know that i was not part of the russian collusion  people may say  hey  look  i want to say democrats may state this memo  revealing of the memo was detriment to national security. i feel that it's necessary to show that this is something that is in play  that donald trump did the right thing and it was  in fact  no russian collusion. heather: necessary to have faith in our leaders. >> absolutely. 	heather: makes sense. 19 after the top of the hour and

chaos in philadelphia overnight. look at all those fans after  of course  their big wince  the eagles  the police trying to keep up with out of control fans  steve from phil  live on the ground with the latest. good morning  steve. >> i don't have good news but by the way i don't look fair and balance  i'm born and raised more than ten minutes from here and you see the date on the back of my jacket  that's how long it's been  you forgive me for being biased on fox which is never biased by the way  anyhow  this is what we like to do in the media  right  the macy's store right across the street from city hall and right to the right is front door of philadelphia city hall where the 	tower you saw lit up during the game. but they got to the front door but they could not loot the store because we in philadelphia we know how to keep people out. they have a second set of doors with the cages  they smashed this door and the windows  took whatever they were wearing  probably was nice stuff and then you heard about people couldn't climb them and you can see  they are replacing the poles because half of dozen traffic lights have been knocked down. these are two main streets  they smashed the lights in and did stupid stuff. i was here in 2008 when the philly's won world series  a lot more damage then and a lot more looting then so philadelphia police knew how the tackle the problem then. only one arrest  i saw and that was a guy that were saving from getting into more trouble  just drunk and kept him safely on the 	sidewalk  not a big deal  i know this looks bad  no were near as bad  no where near as bad as we saw ten years ago  hopefully when we win again  maybe one piece of broken glass in the city now that we know how to win. heather: glass half full  steve  what was your favorite play of the game? >> it had to be the touchdown of quarterback  they needed a first down or a touchdown  that coach  by the way lives around the corner from me  i've been a big fan for ten years  what a great call from doug peterson  i don't think anyone can doubt that he can coach in the nfl  heather. heather: did the play when he was in high school as well. thank you so much steve  love it  thanks. we will be right back  stay with 	us. my name is jeff sheldon  	and i'm the founder of ugmonk. before shipstation it was crazy. it's great when you see a hundred orders come in  a hundred orders come in  but then you realize i've got a hundred orders i have to ship out. shipstation streamlined that wh the order data  the weights of   everything is seamlessly put into shipstation  so when we print the shipping ll everything's pretty much done. it's so much easier so now  we're ready  bring on t. shipstation. the number one ch of online sellers. go to shipstation.com/tv and get two months free. 	earth -- heather: president trump wants to make a deal on immigration. the democrats doesn't. >> daca is absolutely easy to do and i don't think democrats want to take care of daca recipients. they've given up on daca and that's supposed to be theirs  it's ours because we are the 	ones that are taking care of daca and not them. heather: so what's the next move for democrats on immigration and is there resistance  here to weigh in executive director mark  thank you so much for joining us  we appreciate it. >> glass to be here. >> what's the move for democrats  what's the next move that they should make? >> i'm not sure that they have another move. the president gave them an enormous opportunity. he met them more than halfway with proposal that frankly i've been critical of and amnesty of just 2 million people  many more  keeping the waiting list for these chain migration categories so millions of additional people would be able to come in until the chain migration categories were eliminated  they had an opportunity to take the president up but they don't seem to be be able to take yes for an answer. i don't know what they do now 	because i don't think that the least the president can accept is enough -- is something that they would be willing to acknowledge. heather: do you think they are doing it on purpose? >> i don't know. i mean  i don't know that it's parred of a plan  i think the democrats would be happy to get legal status  proper amnesty for the daca's but they aren't willing to make any meaningful concessions at all. the president is -- has basically said  look  we need to fix future immigration so it's less family oriented and i'm willing to document not just daca but millions if you meet me halfway. the democrats have thrown the daca's under the bus in order the keep chain migration. heather: another republican plan being presented today  we just had it up there  hint and coons  no funding for the border wall 	reportedly. >> i don't understand what the point of that plan is because even that gang of 6 proposal that's now defunct but senator durbin proposed it a couple of weeks ago  even that one at least pretended to acknowledge the things the president said he needed to have. this one doesn't even pretend to try to work with the president. so it's not going anywhere. i don't even know what senator mccain is thinking. heather: so what needs to happen to bring both side together and what happens when march comes up and the daca deal is done? >> well  it may not be march because there was a law enforcement that's -- judicial ruling that's held up so march may not be a deadline but it'll come at some point  supreme court will consider it. they are going to overrule that ridiculous decision so it could be april or may  what's going to happen is people are going to start losing their work permits  about a thousand a day  daca's will lose permits  will that 	focus the democrats' attention and make them more willing to cut a deal. i'm skeptical but that's really the only way anything is going to move on this  i think. heather: to one seems to be making a deal so far. we will see if that happens. heather: mark  thank you so much for joining us. appreciate it. that wraps it up for this hour of ""fox & friends first""  congrats to the eagles. ""fox & friends first"" continues right now. bye bye. >> the goal here is to undermine the fbi  discredit the fbi  discredit the mueller investigation  do the president's bidding. >> it is monday february 5th  fallout from the fisa memo heating up as democrats wage in all out information war  will their version of this memo be released today? we are live in washington. >> headed down the wrong track  shocking new details about what 	caused a deadly train crash  why investigators are now saying it could have been prevented. >> brady under pressure. escapes the sack. launching one for the end zone and incomplete. and philadelphia eagles  the long drought is over. rob: one of the best super bowl games i have ever seen. food fights in convenient stores  celebrations turning rowdy over eagles big super bowl win.

points. what does that mean for your wallet and should we be worried just yet? peter morici  thank you for joining us this morning  love to 	have you with us. so this was the worst week in two years  the dow wiped out its 2018 games with its fullback monday. should we be worried? >> we go through corrections from time to time. the trump rally was so continuous with very little volatility but this is a normal thing that happens in markets  we will probably go down further and then start to recover. the fundamentals of the market are still very good. >> this was the largest single day drop in wall street history. if we could pull the graphic up one more time  the biggest drop since august 2015 when the dow fell 1089 points. what caused that  do you remember? >> in 2008 that was the financial crisis  we had very different conditions zen. we had the mortgage crisis  banks were in a great deal of 	trouble. there is no reason to believe our banks are in any difficulty  that loans are not going to be repaid. the fundamentals of the economy are very strong. normally in a week first quarter in these recent years  by all indications the first quarter growth is going to be strong  tax cuts will kick income investments going to pick up. there is no reason to believe profitability is going to be up in the first quarter  we have very good soundings on that and it will likely continue increasing and profits drive the market long-term. in 2008 we had hypervaluations in excess of what we have now and looking at what we pay for earnings  the price-to-earnings ratio. jillian: what about the fear gauge? people here fear gauge and it has gone up 115%. what is that? >> there are measures of how concerned people at the stock exchange and money managers are. and they become

is a market decline and it is a waste of money. if everybody thinks it is going to go up and that is a sure sign that we are going to have a correction because that is how that works and once that happens everybody panics and that is what happened yesterday and i expect the herd to keep running for a while. i don't we are done with this correction. >> what do you think will happen today? the fear of the growing inflation but what about the political climate as well? >> the growing inflation is not present. just because interest rates rise with inflation doesn't mean 	rising interest rates mean inflation. why are interest rates going up? the answer is the fed is raising rates so they get to a more normal level now we are out of the crisis but only talking about raising it 3% because they don't see a lot of inflation. it is that simple. wages are growing at their most rapid pace in years  2.9%. productivity growth gives you inflation of less than 2% which is the fed's target  nothing to worry about on the inflation front and again investors like to have news. >> a lot of news out of this administration when we have fear of another government shutdown and that type of thing but you said don't worry  don't run for the hills yet. >> a government shutdown  who cares? they keep so many things open that basically it is the regulators staying home. that is good for the

very clear to me that i wasn't hearing any call from god to do this. she revealed earlier she was mulling over running for our frank and's vacant senate seat  now it looks like she is not doing that.

washington  donald trump set to approve the release of the democrats version today that is allegedly full of president material. grip jenkins in dc with brand-new bombshell revelations. 	>> reporter: the president may decide as early as today whether to release or block some or all of the democrats counter memo after meeting with deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  chief of staff john kelly says the president has a better understanding of the differences between the two memos. >> i hope the president understands the difference between the first memo  just like in the first memo we received it late last night  the doj  fbi team. >> reporter: them republican lawmakers like trey gourley warned against it  loaded with sensitive information  setting a trap. >> the democrats are politically smart enough to put things in the memo that require either the bureau or the pilot of justice to say it needs to be redacted  therefore it creates this belief that there is something hidden from the american people. >> reporter: this as chuck grassley and lindsey graham release a less redacted version  christopher steel to the doj giving us more information about the fbi's

lights on the motivations of democrats like adam schiff and nancy pelosi who said the president was going to fire rosenstein to create a bit of chaos. we will see how it plays out. 	>> the grassley memo was from 2017? >> reporter: that was last month that letter of referral but in it it addresses what happened back in march when the judiciary committee was meeting with players to arrive at the referral the day they sent for the doj on mister steele. heather: lots more to come on this. we have seen the memos and letters but the firestorm simmers down what comes next? according to fox news legal analyst greg jarrett who has been all over the story  those who swore to uphold the law could find themselves on the other side of the law. >> you need a calculator to add up all the various crimes that were committed by the department of justice and the fbi. they concealed vital facts the court  they deceived the judge in getting the warrant approved  	they knew the dossier was phony  was politically motivated  they knew steel was biased and untrustworthy and have lied. when they signed under penalty of perjury in front of the judge that these are true and honest and credible documents  they were there for lying  committing surgery and for every lie in the eight pages you identified it as a separate crime. >> people at the department of justice and fbi  even those who left

to the democrats. >> the drama continues to be more suspenseful is democrats and republicans and the president try to come to an agreement in resolving the problem  donald trump is demanding democrats agree to cracking down on illegal immigration. if they fail to do that donald trump says he will support another government shutdown. >> we will do a shutdown. it is worth it  i would love to see a shutdown  we have to shut it down because democrats don't want safety and unrelated but still related they don't want to take care of our military  shut it down. >> a shutdown may have been 	averted due to lawmakers in the house passing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded until march 23rd and now goes to the senate where democrats and republicans are talking about making a longer  two year budget deal. >> i am optimistic that soon we will reach an agreement. >> i discussed the outlines  we are very happy. we can get something really good done. >> reporter: if that something really good gets done  two year budget deal gives donald trump time to find agreement with democrats on immigration  democrats want to provide a pathway to citizenship but donald trump insists on having a border wall ending chain migration and the visa lottery  1.8 million dreamers in the united states  donald trump wants to help them but only if democrats agreed to make the 	border more secure  and improving everything down there. heather: we will talk more about this coming up. comments from donald trump taking a big step forward. >> i call it extreme vetting. our country has enough problems

already setting up a fallback plan. >> we want to make sure the white house does not reject on the memo for political purpose  that is a big control. ♪ i know i'm just an outcast ♪ i shouldn't speak

sure any rejections that are made are fully explained to our committee by the fbi was a moment of justice and the white house. we want to make sure the white house does not redact our memo for political purpose and that is a deep concern. >> sources are also telling fox news that the left rebuttal is loaded with sensitive details. what is this -- was a solid track? here to weigh in is john jordan. thank you for joining us  appreciate it. i want to begin with that question. there are some other things you 	want to get into but you believe this is a set up by democrats because they know the president will have to say this can't be released? >> that is precisely what it is. keep in mind the democrats voted in lockstep in committee to prevent not only the republican memo from being released to the public  they voted to prevent it from being released to the house of representatives  now that there is political fallout from that they needed a strategy to blunt the political impact and do some damage control. and that is why they have loaded it with national security sources and methods info so the white house would be obligated to redact it and they will turn around and say they are doing it for political purposes knowing the white house can't adequately defend itself without revealing those sources so it is a secular trap they are setting. >> one of the other issues is the woods procedure. if people at home don't know what that is it was named after an fbi agent  we can show people at home it was implemented for 	incorrect information that was repeated in subsequent packages like signing and swearing to the declaration  headquarters agents  knowledge of what is contained in the declaration. and you think this would be a violation of that. >> the woods procedure is go back to april 2001 and what it illustrates is the number of fingers and hands that were on the steel dossier before it was signed off on under oath before a fisa judge  they have an approval rate of 99% for government applications and they are done in secret so an extra sent didn't set of safeguards was set up that requires not only that special agent doing fieldwork sign off on it  his supervisor  special agent in charge gets kicked up to fbi headquarters  it goes to the doj for the national security division all of whom have to approve it and it is signed under oath from a judge. 	looks like there is criminal wrongdoing  if it is unverified which it appears it was  it illustrates how widespread the swamp may be on the fbi  illustrating quite clearly  attorney general sessions have a terrible time raining in the fbi  and looks like the problem is metastasizing. this is a concern for all americans of correct. heather: not just christopher steal the questions surrounding him  and in any way those sources he used were legit. >> fusion gps  or's wife was killed by fusion gps  and the department of justice to bruce or who hasn't been fired but 	reassigned. heather: we will see what happens to block the release of it. he met with rod rosenstein  perhaps rod rosenstein can say this can't be released  interesting to see what democrats say if that happens if they seem to support him. >> very interesting indeed. the time is almost 20 minutes past the top of the hour  a brand-new policy from a major pharmacy chain. >> i call upon all of us to some of the unity we need to deliver for the people who were elected to serve. heather: donald from calling out democrats for sitting during the state of the union address  carly shimkus is here with a brand-new ad turning the tables on the left. ♪ 	heather: putting politics above the american people do you remember when democrats refused to stand during donald trump's state of the union the president firing back with a new campaign ad. >> i call upon all of us to set aside our differences to seek out common ground and some of the unity we need to deliver for the people we are elected to serve. >> serious xm 115  carly shimkus is here with reaction. >> reporter: donald trump's reelection campaign released a new ad showing prominent democrats who refused to stand during his state of the union address during moments that should have received bipartisan support. take a look. 	>> we have created 2.4 million new jobs. unemployment claims have hit a 45 year low. african-american unemployment stands at the lowest rate

smiled for things they agree with but the dnc would be really angry  no doubt  party over people. there has been hostility on both sides of the aisle  donald trump was criticized for suggesting democrats committed treason for refusing to stand during his state of the union address. heather: democrats alleging the president committed treason multiple times so far during his administration. another issue  something else happening involving a school musical. 	>> high school in new york  canceling production of the hunchback of notre dame because a white student received the role of as morale the. angry students sent the school a letter saying the young woman who was cast in this role has a large  blonde hair and is the epitome of whiteness legit best this is cultural appropriation  at worst it was whitewashing. she is a good actor  good dancer  any production would be lucky to have her but is not right for the role. so the school canceled the production. social media sounding off  braden says this is getting ridiculous  creating a culture of victimhood is terrible for the country. dale brings up a point saying what happened to the best person getting the role because of their performance? heather: we have heard of these issues happening in hollywood as well. i am one of these people who did this yesterday  retweeted the launch of elon musk's massive 	space x rocket.

>> capitol hill producer chad program has been on the floor 	all night long and joins us from statuary hall with the latest developments. how are you feeling? >> i feel great  ready to go. heather: what were his main arguments. >> they are raising the spending caps. you might remember when they raise the debt ceiling in 2011. the deal was they imposed the sequestration spending defense and non-defense program so here we are 7 years down the road and part of this bill suspends the debt ceiling through much of 2019 and they are lifting the spending caps. that is the trade-off this time when it was the converse seven years ago. this arrangement is going to raise spending by $400 billion. 	it is also going to approve $89 billion in hurricane and disaster relief  puerto rico  texas  florida  california wildfires and he is saying wait a minute  none of this is checked. all rand paul wanted was a vote on reimposing the sequestration spending caps. keep in mind the other issue at hand here. this bill only funds the government through march 23rd so if the house votes in the next hour or so to sync up with the senate a couple hours ago the government is only open through march 23rd and then you could have another fight over  say  immigration or daca or a border wall standoff. heather: when and how will it come up. >> this is meddlesome for house democrats and many of them are going to oppose it  something house minority leader nancy pelosi implored the house speaker  paul ryan to make a commitment  she was very frank in her language  she wanted him to  quote  man up  that was her term  and put a daca bill on the 	floor. the senate has a different range but the majority leader  mitch mcconnell said the government is open starting february 8th  february 9th  there would be a freewheeling debate on immigration in the senate with border security  daca  could deal with chain migration. all of those issues and he has already set up a procedural those for monday afternoon to get onto that bill so that will be in the senate next week. heather: going through the funding and what is being spent here  was there something done in terms of giving things democrats? they are getting a lot in here  $131 billion for domestic programs in addition to the military increase you were talking about  do you think they received some more so there would be some leeway? >> absolutely  this is something democrats wanted  opioid funding  they wanted to deal 	with broadband  there were health issues that were very important and they were concerned they were only going to close up the defense side. that is what the house bill that originally  kept the government open  the bill they passed raising defense spending  democrat said that is not fair so people thought they could have added - and gotten an arrangement on daca. strzok -- daca is the electric is on capitol hill and that is why there's a little uncertainty at this early hour of the morning as to whether or not the house will pass this and sync up with the senate. here is the voting map. we believe the house republicans need to get 150 of their members  that is still losing 80 some. to make up the difference  to make up the vote deficit they will need 70 democrats  that is a pretty tall order especially when there's no daca arrangement and house minority leader nancy pelosi says she likes some of the elements of the role but is voting against it. >> it exchange with the children's health insurance program by four years ago infrastructure funding  $20 	million  lifts the debt limit into march 2019. what happens then after march 23rd? >> that is keeping the government open the rest of this fiscal year through september 30th and they don't have any of that  by last september 30th  on this fifth interim spending bill the house approves this in the next few hours that will be the fifth stopgap spending plan. that is why all the fires are not put out yet. the bulk of this bill  what it does even though it deals with funding the government and the government is shut down as we speak right now until 4:00 in the morning  it raises those caps and does other things. the direct federal spending this controls is only the interim spending that keeps the government open at existing levels through march 23rd. some people might be a forgotten problem  a snake in the grass until the end of march. heather: they are expected to vote between 4:00  and 5:30 this 	morning. >> reporter: a signal that in the house of representatives. it might not be on the actual bill. i can tell you if you bear with me for a minute  as far as we can tell we believe it is on the rule. the rule was the procedural vote in the house of representatives when you bring a piece of legislation to the floor you first have to approve the rule  the rule sets the terms of debate and what is unclear is whether they approve the voice vote or voting on that yet but that will come soon  that up or down vote. heather: we will you get back to that. thank you for joining us  appreciate it  long night. brand-new bombshell text messages happening overnight obtained by fox news revealing a questionable relationship involving the top democrat in 	the senate's russia probe. todd pyro is here with new developments unfolding at this hour. >> reporter: democrat senator might have some explaining to do  the lawmaker who held numerous press conferences over the past year promising a fair bipartisan investigation into donald trump's ties to russia trying to gain access through christopher steele. the author of the anti-trump dossier writing  quote  so much to discuss  you need to be careful. but we can help our country. national correspondent ed henry obtaining ted henry's texts  he would rather not have a paper trail in case you cannot seal an agreement with the former british spy. donald trump slamming warner on twitter writing  quote  senator 	mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for russian oligarch  warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting in london  he requested with fraudulent dossier fame all tied into crooked hillary. this is just the tip of the iceberg as new text messages between fbi lovers expressing concern  peter strzok and lisa page  classified email  strzok texting remind me to tell you to flag for andy  emails we found at portions on a couple cameras  doj was very concerned about that. a follow-up text the next day reading  quote  found on the 30 k emails provided originally  no one noticed  cuts against  i never sent or received anything 	marked classified. problem is clinton cited as late as july 2  2016  that she never sent material that was marked classified and on we go. heather: what happened on specific dates these text messages were sent and a lot of people looking at it now. heather: the spotlight towards barack obama's white house  allegations of corruption swirling around  david limbaugh says the former president has been kept at a distance because he stacked his administration with people to protect him but limbaugh said the day of reckoning could be coming. >> obama was virtually immune for everything he did  no accountability  politicizing literally every agency he was 	important. the irs  we know what he did to the irs turning on political opponents  lois lerner  whatever  and what they did with the fbi and the doj  they have been staffing these agencies  the doj and political operatives who care more about the liberal agenda to the rule of law. a counter investigation that someone appointed special counsel under the doj study to investigate the obama davos because they were protecting hillary and influencing an election. heather: donald trump is expected to announce today whether to detoxify the memo  this refutes the gop allegations by the fbi in efforts to monitor former trump campaign advisor carter page  happening today as well. the time is 11 minutes after the 	top of the hour. mike pence sending a strong message to north korea before the olympics. >> we will not allow north korea the reality that they enslave the people and threaten the wider region. >> foreign policy advisor says the us is not playing games. remember when the obama administration sent $1 billion of cash to iran  you will never guess where that turned up. ll en unlimited double miles on every purchase  every day. not just airline purchases.

>> the partner doesn't remember anything. rob: what would cause that? >> it is weird. that is why it is not settled yet. what the fbi has done by their announcement is we have enough information now to rule out murder by somebody coming across 	from mexico or whatever it is and that is because of their investigation and no injuries on the individual that indicates he was fighting with anybody in the injuries released so far on the right side of the body  which is more indicative of a fall from the right side. carly: that includes fractures to his skull  right jaw  upper ribs and right collarbone. you think of somebody getting hit by a car wouldn't you normally think there would be injuries to the abdomen? does that sound more like somebody hit him over the head or assaulted him? >> in an assault you should get left and right injuries and number 2  the initial report from the sheriff's office with responsibility for investigating the case is he might have been sideswiped by a car on the 	culvert. being struck by a vehicle could get the top part of the head  shoulder or clavicle. on the right side so far. so it is consistent with that but they couldn't confirm that. carly: his partner  stephen garland  was severely injured. he was there but can't remember what happened. if you look at his brain and do a scan of his injuries could that give you any clue as to what happened to the officer that died?

anyway the judge can be fair? >> i believe the judge can be fair. my experience with the federal judiciary is they call balls and strikes fairly and the issues here are completely different  they are unique in a certain sense. there is a simple question whether or not an environmental regulation needs to be complied with before the wall can go forward. there is a federal issue before the judge. i think you are going to see a straightaway argument the government and what environmental activists are putting forth this argument and a fair ruling. i don't believe the back story is going to impact the result. heather: if the ruling is favorable to the white house it would let the administration issue some waivers on environmental laws that would allow them to build sections of the border. >> right. it has nothing to do with the 	wall itself. it is whether or not the government has the ability to advance track this and waive some regulations lose the underlying theory here is why we have those regulations and environmental activist group could file this kind of claim is a different question. that is a policy question and i think it is too much power for environmental activists to try to stop this project but the legal issues before the court i do believe and confident it will be called fairly. heather: the constitution as you said guarantees equal treatment under the law but look at some of the issues we talk about every day. it does appear sometimes that always is and the case. >> i agree with you  it is certainly not the case when we talk about treatment of donald trump versus hillary clinton in some of these underlying email 	scandals and everything else  but that  let's understand the judiciaries call balls and strikes. if a judge gets it wrong they get it wrong and you appeal the case and deal with it through the appellate process. that is our process. there is a separation between the executive and judicial branch for a reason. i am hopeful that this judge will set aside what happened in the past and i don't see it being biased. the government thought he was going to be by they have a right to move to recuse this judge. we haven't seen that yet. the lawyers involved will make that call and the judge will make the call based on the law presented and that is what the federal judge should do. heather: we will see what happens today  thank you for joining us this morning  appreciate it  have a great day. the time is 20 minutes until the top of the hour and market 	mayhem  the dow jones plunging 1000 points  the second time in four days. how are things looking ahead of the open today?

here is the new editor in chief of campusreform.org  lawrence jones. congratulations on that. >> thanks for having me this morning. heather: is it a good idea for democrats coming back around? >> it doesn't demonstrate a candidate that can connect with the american people. president obama won because of hope and change. when donald trump won it was because the american people were so upset the president didn't deliver on that hope and change and he won counties obama won. democrats have got to pick a candidate that can deliver to the american people and they have to focus on the economy. none of the candidates will 	focus on that. what they will do is go after the personality of the president and that put the usual donald trump and not the american people. heather: let's listen to what eric holder had to say about the potential run. >> are you thinking of running for office?

isn't that the very definition of intellectual dishonesty? rob: that is the refrain your hear from a number of republicans in congress  the house freedom caucus mindset  our government is way overburdened financially. what you are doing is just 	adding to the problem but as we saw on the scoreboard moments ago republicans in the house and senate saying this is what we need to keep the government open  deficits be damned. carly: democrats don't like this because there's no attachment immigration reform  nancy pelosi speaking for eight hours wednesday because she wants protection for dreamers. they will be voting on immigration  a whole separate ball game. we just got to get this through the house so we can reopen the government. let's bring in republican congressman ron estes who just cast his vote. thank you for joining us. what is going on?

>> he has a valid point. there are positive things in this bill in terms of funding defense and making sure we 	support our troops. we have been pushing through this agenda the president supported of getting the economy going and tax cuts and getting this defense appropriation supported but now we have to turn to the big problem which is our budget deficit and how much we are spending. this argument tells with less than 22% of the budget. we have to focus on entitlements and focus on that. rob: are we going to be back here? >> the reason for the march 23rd date is with budget caps being lifted for defense and non-defense spending appropriators need to make sure the programs are identified in dollar amounts and that gives four or five weeks through the process and make sure that goes well. carly: this is a major change 	from have republicans acted under the obama administration where they were really concerned about ballooning national debt  right? >> i ran because i wanted to make sure we address the deficit. that is a big concern of mine for myself  my children  my country and we got to address that  partly with cuts and getting growth going and that is what tax cut and jobs act did. now we have to make sure the growth happens in come back and focus on the entire federal budget and make sure we are spending money appropriately and ultimately it takes longer than one year but have to spend only what we bring in it not overspend. >> so many republicans in congress on the fiscal side and put in by constituents who want to see the government shrink  a 	tough sell with them in terms. go get some sleep. we will be right back. train together in simulators  to know exactly what to do before they have to do it. because safety is never being satisfied. and always working to be better. from the moment you met you wantecomfort and protection that's why pampers swaddlers is the #1 choice of hospitals to wrap your baby in blanket-like softness so all they feel is love pampers swaddlers 	[ click  keyboard clacking ] [ keyboard clacking ] [ click  keyboard clacking ] ♪ 	good questions lead to good answers. our advisors can help you find both. talk to one today and see why we're bullish on the future. yours. rob: live look at capitol hill  the government back up and running. ten minutes ago the house passed the budget deal earlier in the evening passed by the senate  house voted 240-186  obstacles on the progressive left and the conservative fiscal rate. a lot more coverage over the next few minutes on ""fox and friends"" first and coming up on ""fox and friends"". carly: this raises spending two years funding the government through march 23rd. let's go to more news. all about money. $1.7 billion obama 	administration paid the iranians went into the hands of iran back to terrorists  the washington times reports the government traced the transferred you as cash back to terrorist groups including hezbollah as well as several rebel groups. the obama administration maintained the payments made two years ago was paid part of the settlement over irani and claims to regime assets used for an arms deal in a 70s. rob: a journalist calls for a professor to drown their all conservative students. is the ferrari responding to a post about teachers lowering conservative student grades tweeting they shouldn't do that. it is not right. they should hold the conservative students heads underwater until they stop breathing instead. he followed that with saying i'm not joking about that part. 	former employer saying defending his stance. carly: let's switch gears  look at the bunnies on screen. a modern makeover for children's classic  everyone's favorite peter rabbit hopping into theaters today. rob: is it worth your box office bucks?

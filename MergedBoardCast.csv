rob: chad program has been on the floor all night long. >> joining us from statuary hall with the latest developments. it has been a very busy night. what is going on? >> we are 35 to 40 minutes away from the house of representatives starting to cast ballots for this budget package  they started a debate 15 minutes ago. the key  the final step to turn off the government shutdown. the senate didn't vote until after midnight so the government did shutdown  because of that delay  rand paul  the senate needs to get unanimous consent 	to do things  99 cm wanted to move this over to the house of representatives before midnight  rand paul said no because he wanted to make a point about the exploding deficits and that is why there is risk as to whether the bill will pass early this morning. there will be some republican defections. conservative members especially members of the freedom caucus don't like the extra deficit spending. they like additional funding for the military but also domestic spending they have a lot of problems with. this is why the top democrat on the committee on the appropriations committee says she likes the other things they are doing on this bill but the other day she cannot consider this bill in a vacuum. democrats want daca. nancy pelosi has been making that case  she took forth on the house floor for eight hours a couple days ago. a record-breaking speech  longest in-house history making that case for daca. 	you need to get this right  150 republicans  70 democrats but when you have someone of nancy pelosi's caliber  former speaker  minority leader saying she is not going to vote for the latter democrats follow her lead. rob: we are watching nancy pelosi on the floor  hopefully this won't take eight hours. are all indications right now that we are going to get something close to that? >> i have been checking with sources since last night  one senior republican source didn't think it was going to be a problem. 40 minutes ago i asked steve scully's  the top vote counter in the house of this would pass and he said  quote  oh yeah. carly: i feel there is a sense of confusion what they are voting on. two your deal  two year deal  what they are voting on will 	just fund the government through march 23rd and then we have to do this all over again. >> reporter: this is a complicated bill. it lists spending caps for defense and on defense for two years. you are available  the funding is available  funds the government through march 23rd  but facing a third shutdown over border wall funding or something  that could be an issue in coming months. the other issue suspending the debt ceiling through march 19th. keep in mind what this debate was about. in 2011 they had a fight over the debt ceiling. in order to raise the debt ceiling the trade-off is we have to impose budget so the debate in 2018 is to suspend the debt ceiling through march 2019 and say we have to list those caps. think how much things have 	changed on a debate. in 2011 the tea party came to power  tried to cut spending in washington. rob: a lot of fiscal conservatives not happy with the budget deal being voted on in the next couple minutes. we will let you get back to it  keep us posted through the course of the show and on ""fox and friends"". another fox news alert. targeting homeless people in las vegas  hunting surveillance video showing the man walking up and shooting him in cold blood. the series of attacks killing two and wanting two others for a 5 day span beginning january 29th. three of the victims were homeless and forensics prove the same gun was used in all four attacks. police have no suspects though they believe the gunman's vehicle has been spotted. carly: we are learning the identity of the officer shot and killed in the line of duty  david shepard  a 30-year-old veteran of the police department is remembered as a devout 	christian father and jokester. the department setting up a donation page for his wife and their two young daughters. responders from several debarment escorted the 37-year-old body to dallas funeral home overnight  his sister saying shepard felt being a police officer with god's calling. rob: assuring unlisted dreamers they don't have to worry about immigration status  they are protected from deportation. jim mattis making the announcement saying 900 soldiers registered under the daca can stay less convicted of serious felony. the daca program allows immigrants run illegally as children to stay in the us without facing deportation  could expire in a few weeks. carly: the white house defending its handling of rob porter. spokesman saying the administration was not fully aware of the extent of the 	allegations against him. >> in the case of rob porter we relied on the background check investigative process. that process hadn't been completed  relying on the information we had. violence against women in these allegations very seriously. carly: a letter sent to the chief of staff  quote  we are processing troubling allegations  domestic violence is abhorrent and no place in our society. former white house aide rob border turning his resignation and after pictures of an ex-wife with a black eye surface to. rob: stocks plunging more than 1000 points for the second time this week. carly: the tao shedding just under 1033 points yesterday losing four points  2% of the value and erasing a midweek rebound. 	rob: the crew that needs to clap when the tao bumps back. blue chip index on its worst weekly percentage drop since the 2008 financial crisis but economists say it will turn correction to the big gains made last year. carly: a quarter of 1 million people celebrating the super bowl champion eagles with a victory parade. rob: good news if you are jillian  the traditional members parade with this colorful outfit. look at that. before delivering a spirited speech to the philly faithful from the steps of that iconic museum of art. >> run faster. we wanted it more. all the players come all the coaches. carly: that huge crowd  one of the biggest joining the last 	visit in the world series parade. from that to the pope. rob: it is 5:09 on the east coast  the mystery of the death of a border patrol agent widening. forensic pathologist doctor michael bought it takes a look at the case  murder can't be ruled out. carly: text messages revealing a questionable relationship involving top democrat in the senate russia probe but is he the one with a kremlin secret?

>> the partner doesn't remember anything. rob: what would cause that? >> it is weird. that is why it is not settled yet. what the fbi has done by their announcement is we have enough information now to rule out murder by somebody coming across 	from mexico or whatever it is and that is because of their investigation and no injuries on the individual that indicates he was fighting with anybody in the injuries released so far on the right side of the body  which is more indicative of a fall from the right side. carly: that includes fractures to his skull  right jaw  upper ribs and right collarbone. you think of somebody getting hit by a car wouldn't you normally think there would be injuries to the abdomen? does that sound more like somebody hit him over the head or assaulted him? >> in an assault you should get left and right injuries and number 2  the initial report from the sheriff's office with responsibility for investigating the case is he might have been sideswiped by a car on the 	culvert. being struck by a vehicle could get the top part of the head  shoulder or clavicle. on the right side so far. so it is consistent with that but they couldn't confirm that. carly: his partner  stephen garland  was severely injured. he was there but can't remember what happened. if you look at his brain and do a scan of his injuries could that give you any clue as to what happened to the officer that died? >> yes. i am sure the medical examiner and the fbi have taken that into consideration. all the hospital binders  when he called his first call to dispatch with it was a vehicular accident. 	there is a deep culvert and it is interesting to note  until 2003  there were reported 38 line of duty fatal injuries  most of them were vehicle injuries. rob: we are going to leave it here because we are getting the house vote. we are not done with this story by any stretch. carly: we need to know what happened. rob: thank you very much. as promised  fox news alert  live look at the house floor where the vote on the budget is underway. carly: we are seeing people on the house floor  they are voting  141 eas for republicans  41 nays  live update next. rob: three democratic eas so far but in the course of the morning and the course of the last week  the republicans really want to 	get to that 150  160 mark and curious to see if they get there. 70 democrats is enough. with that  we are going to go to a commercial. we will see you back here in two minutes. ah  it's so fresh. and it's going to last from wash to... ...wear for up to 12 weeks. unstopables by downy. on thousands of hotels  cars and things to do. like the papaya playa project for 49% off. everything you need to go. expedia. 	everything you need to go. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 	with three extrairst absorb channels.r they stay up to three times drier so babies can sleep soundly all night pampers 	rob: fox news alert  house vote underway. carly: let's go to chad  what is going on? a little bit of action. >> reporter: this vote would think the house of representatives with the senate when they pass this bill in the we hours of the morning  the vote in the senate was overwhelming  71-28. at the house floor  i see 	something interesting developing. we talked earlier that they need 70 democrats to make up the difference  republicans would defect on this bill  undermine conservatives like the house freedom caucus  they don't like this bill because of the deficit spending  the same reservation rand paul  the republican senator from kentucky  had. that is why he delayed the senate from voting on the bill until we hours of the morning. when i look at the scoreboard  they only have three democratic yeses on the board  they probably need 70  there are 150 plus republicans in the house  that is the ceiling they could get to. if democrats don't start delivering their votes this bill could be in trouble but i say this with the caveat  democrats want to see how high the republican threshold could be. when you get into a vote like this where you need this amount 	of democrats and republicans to move the bill  the other party sits on its hands and sees what the other side can deliver but that number has not moved in a while since i have been looking at this and that could signal a problem. when you are thinking you need 70 votes i don't know. the thing that was giving some concern at the capital was any time you rely on the other side you don't know how the vote is going to go in the other problem with this is sometimes they say we have people we are going to vote yes. unless you truly know  that is the problem. the case could be made at rand paul by delaying the vote might have an impact. democrats can't vote  this could be in trouble in the government could remain shut down longer than people expected. rob: we will check back with you throughout the course of this half-hour  thanks as always. now to something completely different but equally 	disturbing  every move you make  every step you take and i am not singing a song. google. are they watching you? carly: media giants could be crossing the line and collecting your personal data. here with more is fox news headlines anchor  i got to say you do a fantastic job on tucker carlson's show  you have a cell phone in your pocket  two cell phones in your pocket and the reason you did that is because you turned off  the sim card  turned off wi-fi  and what did you discover? we have a control  airplane note  it was on but not set to connect and we drove around dc and what we found was disturbing 	in that the phone is still tracking you even without a data connection  it gets all kind of data points from mechanisms inside the phone  stores those and we were able to capture that data when we got back to dc and see what the phone sensed to google which is encrypted. we have the ability to do that and the information they were finding was shocking  how deep down the data goes. rob: what surprised me was airplane mode  you are telling us getting in and out of cars. >> the caveat or the hidden secrets  take your pick  airplane mode turns off the cellular modem and turns off the wi-fi but there is other equipment in the phone  and accelerometer and barometric pressure sensor and navigation equipment that still picks up 	gps  so it knows at this gps coordinate  you walked 5 miles an hour that direction  it can put the pieces together and figure out where you went. carly: is it because of advertising? >> it is because of advertising  they are tracking you  they can whittle those ads down  those are the issues i looked at on amazon or the hard drive i was going to buy or store i like to go to  they want to know you go to dunkin' donuts every morning or the pet store every day and don't buy the puppy. they want to know all those things so the advertisements you see are applicable to you because you are more likely to click on it. carly: i am not concerned  you are. >> i am boring too. >> the data we got from airplane mode was shocking. 	carly: usually a rock afterwards. rob: thanks for being here. we are back on the spending bill  live in dc with the latest. zantac works in as little as 30 minutes. nexium can take 24 hours. try cool mint zantac. no pill relieves heartburn faster. ♪ cleaning floors with a mop and bucket is a hassle. swiffer wetjet makes cleaning easy. it's safe to use on all finished surfaces. trapping dirt and liquid inside the pad. plus  it prevents streaks better than a micro fiber strip mop. for a convenient clean  try swiffer wetjet. morning on the beach until... it... wasn't. don't let type 2 diabetes get between you and your heart. because your risk of heart attack or stroke is up to four times greater. but there are steps you can take to lower your cardiovascular risk. talk to your health care provider today 	about diabetic heart disease. and find out more at heartoftype2.com. your heart and type 2 diabetes. make the connection. 	heather: we were back with fox news alert  4:30 on the east coast  live look at capitol hill where the house is working in overdrive to approve this budget package after successfully passing the senate just hours ago. that vote being 71-28 and we are told a procedural vote was 	happening just ended the meaning debate is set to begin next and after that the vote will take place. we are told the house with  steve scalise  spoke to chad a short time ago and said they do have the house votes to pass the budget plan. griff jenkins standing by in washington dc with the latest developments. lots happening. i don't know if i had that right. >> reporter: totally right. an exciting morning. if you are a federal government employee you wonder if you got the day off  going into work  with steve scalise  the house whip  if you are a government employee you are coming to work. the procedural vote as we head into debate  let's quickly address the sticking points. on the republican side  conservatives who are fiscal hawks like rand paul are saying 	measure that only funds the government through march 23rd of this year. the vote was 71-28 but the government shutdown happened  senator rand paul went on an hours long speech  absolutely in protest of the raising of the deficit. here is what he said. >> i ran for office because i was very critical of president obama's trillion dollar deficits. now we have republicans hand-in-hand with democrats offering us trillion dollar deficits. who is to blame? both parties. we have a 700 page bill that no one has read  it was printed at midnight. >> reporter: waiting for this debate to start  probably not likely  checking  not likely to see a rand paul moment on the 	house floor where someone hijacked it essentially. we are certainly going to hear some short passionate speeches on both sides. heather: pretty late for them. they are not used to working at this hour. we are  4:30 in the morning on the east coast. in terms of stumbling blocks moving forward it does spend a lot of money  $165 billion more for the military  100 the $1 billion more for domestic programs. where do you see problems? >> you are also going to add $100 billion for those hurricanes i covered  the wildfire relief. it is the debt ceiling increased through march 2019  that is the stickler for anyone that came to congress as a fiscal conservative to try the best they could to get a grasp on the 	pocketbook. we will see what happens. that will be a sticking point. heather: $20 million for infrastructure funding and all through march 25th. thank you so much  appreciate it  lots of work  thank you. here is the question. that $1.7 billion the obama administration paid the iranians  guess where that went? into the hands of iran backed terrorists was the washington times reports the us government has traced some of the transfer of direct cashback to terrorist groups including hezbollah and several rebel groups lose the obama administration maintains the public made two years ago as part of a settlement over iranian claims to regime assets used for an arms deal in the 70s. another longtime aide to james comey retiring after 33 years. fox news confirming michael corbin is leaving his post as assistant director of public affairs. it was mentioned in a newly 	surfaced text message from peter strzok to lisa page  turning over documents and hillary clinton email investigation. it is not clear if his retirement was prompted by recent events. remember the judge donald trump called out for being biased against him?

anyway the judge can be fair? >> i believe the judge can be fair. my experience with the federal judiciary is they call balls and strikes fairly and the issues here are completely different  they are unique in a certain sense. there is a simple question whether or not an environmental regulation needs to be complied with before the wall can go forward. there is a federal issue before the judge. i think you are going to see a straightaway argument the government and what environmental activists are putting forth this argument and a fair ruling. i don't believe the back story is going to impact the result. heather: if the ruling is favorable to the white house it would let the administration issue some waivers on environmental laws that would allow them to build sections of the border. >> right. it has nothing to do with the 	wall itself. it is whether or not the government has the ability to advance track this and waive some regulations lose the underlying theory here is why we have those regulations and environmental activist group could file this kind of claim is a different question. that is a policy question and i think it is too much power for environmental activists to try to stop this project but the legal issues before the court i do believe and confident it will be called fairly. heather: the constitution as you said guarantees equal treatment under the law but look at some of the issues we talk about every day. it does appear sometimes that always is and the case. >> i agree with you  it is certainly not the case when we talk about treatment of donald trump versus hillary clinton in some of these underlying email 	scandals and everything else  but that  let's understand the judiciaries call balls and strikes. if a judge gets it wrong they get it wrong and you appeal the case and deal with it through the appellate process. that is our process. there is a separation between the executive and judicial branch for a reason. i am hopeful that this judge will set aside what happened in the past and i don't see it being biased. the government thought he was going to be by they have a right to move to recuse this judge. we haven't seen that yet. the lawyers involved will make that call and the judge will make the call based on the law presented and that is what the federal judge should do. heather: we will see what happens today  thank you for joining us this morning  appreciate it  have a great day. the time is 20 minutes until the top of the hour and market 	mayhem  the dow jones plunging 1000 points  the second time in four days. how are things looking ahead of the open today?

here is the new editor in chief of campusreform.org  lawrence jones. congratulations on that. >> thanks for having me this morning. heather: is it a good idea for democrats coming back around? >> it doesn't demonstrate a candidate that can connect with the american people. president obama won because of hope and change. when donald trump won it was because the american people were so upset the president didn't deliver on that hope and change and he won counties obama won. democrats have got to pick a candidate that can deliver to the american people and they have to focus on the economy. none of the candidates will 	focus on that. what they will do is go after the personality of the president and that put the usual donald trump and not the american people. heather: let's listen to what eric holder had to say about the potential run. >> are you thinking of running for office? >> i will make a decision by the end of the year about whether there is another chapter. >> i will make a decision at the end of this year about what i want to do with regard to higher office. heather: right now he's touring the country talking about redrawing congressional district lines. is that something he can build off of? >> no. he has been one of the leaders of the resistance  talking about black lives matter and other 	groups that really dislikes the president. it will take more than that and that is such a narrow group of support. you have to find a way to connect to the working class  the forgotten americans. you are not going to be able to go into district and county's chronic racism. these are the same people that voted for barack obama. you got to focus on them and eric holder  just focus on donald trump's personality. heather: why not joe biden? >> he is a different one. uncle joe is older. joe does have the personality  he is from delaware and he does know the american people especially he connects with a lot of those blue dog democrats. joe has been away from politics for a little while and hasn't connected with those people in those counties. 	it would be an interesting race. not sure he has the support to win a presidential race. heather: just got through the first year and already talking about 20/20. thank you for joining us  appreciate it. have a great weekend and we will be right back  stay with us. 	>> we return with a fox news 	alert  debating the budget deal  the $400 billion budget deal past the senate 71-28 we will continue to monitor that. if the house passes the budget deal it will fund the government through march 23rd so we will see if that happens. a major iphone is shared in the biggest leak in history. a key piece of the software getting leaked on the software development platform  experts fear they may break into apple's operating the semantic of people's data. and any potential vulnerability would be outdated. they have removed the code. they are testing a new feature. they quickly explained this isn't a dislike button  it is 	meant to resource comments as offensive  misleading or off-topic not showing negative reaction  not testing the download button in groups with public figures or comments from friends. forget going to the supermarket  amazon is now delivering whole foods right to your door. prime members can get the deliveries in to be 2 hours or less. it is only available in four major us cities  the announcement  6 months after amazon  $13.7 billion. >> ""fox and friends"" first continues  i will see you monday  have a great weekend  goodbye. rob: it is friday  february 9th. this is a fox news alert  live 	look at the house floor where shutdown showdown part 2 is underway. the government has been closed for five hours and a bipartisan budget deal back in the house and senate after midnight. we are live in washington where a vote is expected any minute. jillian: cold hard cash in hand killers  president obama pay the iranians $1.7 billion  new proof that it landed in the hands of terrorists. >> professors should drown conservative students  the remarks from a liberal journalist  ""fox and friends"" first  very busy friday  continues right now. ♪"
"2",2018-02-09 06:00:00,"rob: what a difference three minutes makes. when we checked in with thad program moments ago  that number  the democratic ea column was 3. as you can see now  up to 67. carly: magic number for democrats is 70. we are getting very close. the house and senate totally different animals  the senate passed the budget deal 71-28 very quickly after rand paul closing down a little bit. the house was supposed to be 	more of a challenge. so far those gays are taking up  we just hit 70 eas for democrats. we should talk about what is in here when we get down a little bit. >> $165 billion for the military  $131 billion for domestic programs. on the republican side republicans were pushing for the increase in military spending but in order to get that they had to cave on domestic programs  $131 billion  the reason rand paul was filibustering long into the evening and delaying this vote until right now. we were expecting this earlier. carly: rand paul is one of the reasons we arguably missed that midnight deadline because he did slow things down. he released a statement saying tonight you can feel the frustration growing in congress as we expose the hypocrisy of 	republicans joining in an unholy alliance and spending free-for-all with democrats  he is very angry budget deal is so expensive. rob: let's hear little bit more. >> they are holding hands and only one bad guy standing in the way it will keep it here until 3:00 in the morning. the country is worth a debate until 3:00 in the morning. the reason i am here tonight is put people on the spot. i want people to feel uncomfortable. i want them to have to answer people at home who said how come you were against president obama's deficit but for republican deficits? isn't that the very definition of intellectual dishonesty? rob: that is the refrain your hear from a number of republicans in congress  the house freedom caucus mindset  our government is way overburdened financially. what you are doing is just 	adding to the problem but as we saw on the scoreboard moments ago republicans in the house and senate saying this is what we need to keep the government open  deficits be damned. carly: democrats don't like this because there's no attachment immigration reform  nancy pelosi speaking for eight hours wednesday because she wants protection for dreamers. they will be voting on immigration  a whole separate ball game. we just got to get this through the house so we can reopen the government. let's bring in republican congressman ron estes who just cast his vote. thank you for joining us. what is going on? how did you vote? >> the measure just passed  i 	voted for it. rob: we saw the numbers on the screen. it was low in the beginning. what happened? momentum to get democrats up or who was voting and when they were voting? >> one of the things democrats wanted to make a statement and show they were contributing to passing this bill  they were over 60% of republicans voted and half of democrats voted as well. rob: the shutdown is officially over with his vote so government workers go to work as scheduled. i got to say your colleague senator rand paul is upset because he thinks this is too expensive. he is a fiscal conservative and a lot of people on the republican side agree with him. do you?

they are getting a lot in here  $131 billion for domestic programs in addition to the military increase you were talking about  do you think they received some more so there would be some leeway? >> absolutely  this is something democrats wanted  opioid funding  they wanted to deal 	with broadband  there were health issues that were very important and they were concerned they were only going to close up the defense side. that is what the house bill that originally  kept the government open  the bill they passed raising defense spending  democrat said that is not fair so people thought they could have added - and gotten an arrangement on daca. strzok -- daca is the electric is on capitol hill and that is why there's a little uncertainty at this early hour of the morning as to whether or not the house will pass this and sync up with the senate. here is the voting map. we believe the house republicans need to get 150 of their members  that is still losing 80 some. to make up the difference  to make up the vote deficit they will need 70 democrats  that is a pretty tall order especially when there's no daca arrangement and house minority leader nancy pelosi says she likes some of the elements of the role but is voting against it. >> it exchange with the children's health insurance program by four years ago infrastructure funding  $20 	million  lifts the debt limit into march 2019. what happens then after march 23rd?

that affects hundreds of thousands of people in america to finally debate in the senate. >> republican senator john mccain and chris cooms are introducing bipartisan plan to pathway to citizenship. 	it's time we end the gridlock so we can quickly move onto completing a long-term budget agreement that provides our men and women in uniform the support they deserve while reaching a deal cannot some soon enough for america's service members  the current political reality demands bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the daca program and secure this southern border  lawmakers have until this thursday february 8th to approve funding and possibly  possibly get a deal on daca  if not  there could be another government shutdown on thursday. heather: yeah  the mccain-coons probably doesn't include border funding for a wall. we always talk about what's in it before we know what's in. kelly wright live for us  appreciate it. despite criticism from conservative republicans former white house chief of staff 	reince priebus defending to offer path of citizenship for nearly 2 million dreamers  not only does it force democrats to make the next move but it's the president's way of calling bluff on daca. >> i think that if you look at what's happening in the economy  you look at tax cuts an unemployment  i think those things matter a lot. i actually thing he is doing better  he did better with black voters and hispanic voters in the election  i think we can do more. i think the president's position that he's taking on the dreamers and daca is very bold  i think he's boxed the democrats in on that issue  i think it'll be very difficult for them to walk away from. he's giving more than i probably would have given in the same advice to him but i also think it's clever of him to offer far more on daca than what most republicans would have offered because i think it boxes 	everyone else in. i think it's very smart. heather: another

of the headlines there. here to weigh in former nypd lieutenant darren  thank you so much for joining us. >> thanks for having me  heather. heather: what about this  is the release antilaw enforcement? >> no  it's not. you to take into consideration what it is. when you look at three components of government  executive branch in particular that's at the forefront of law 	enforcement and that's what trump represents  when you look at the campaign  he was adamant supporter of law enforcement  so in terms of the transparency with this memo  i think it was sound and it was necessary  this fisa memo came out and it showed that  look  trump didn't do anything wrong  so moving forward he railed against the -- i want to say the acts of the justice department in connection with this and proves a sound piece that trump did what was necessary and he wasn't a part of this russian collusion. so when you hear things  him railing against the fbi  they overstepped boundaries. heather: its leaders at the top of the fbi and the top of the doj  it's not the ranking file  the ranking file i should say and the men and women that go out and do the job every single day. let's look at the

investigation. >> you know  i disagree. i'm a strong proponent of the president and the position he's taking moving forward. one of the things that president trump did that was very necessary was the firing of james comey. i think that he was in play when a lot of the oversteps by the fisa memo were taken place and so he came in  trump rightfully so came in and got rid of them  a lot of people saying that rod rosenstein is being villainized. this is a strong comparison where he's been and goes back to his support  advert support for law enforcement. 	heather: they are supposed to decide today whether to release the democratic memo to the fisa memo that's been released. transparency in and of itself of itself  does transparency make the fbi and the doj weaker in their ability to do their job because that's what this was  it was making them transparent? >> i think transparency is necessary entity not just law enforcement but politics in general and this is something that trump has introduced at the forefront  look  i want to get this out to the american people  i want them to know that i was not part of the russian collusion  people may say  hey  look  i want to say democrats may state this memo  revealing of the memo was detriment to national security. i feel that it's necessary to show that this is something that is in play  that donald trump did the right thing and it was  in fact  no russian collusion. heather: necessary to have faith in our leaders. >> absolutely. 	heather: makes sense. 19 after the top of the hour and they can barely tie shoes but

g.o.p. retreat where there was a train crash. what strikes you on the train is there is no seat belts. ed: thankfully most people were safe including you and your family but one person did died in that crash as well. rachel: 50 people injured and two dead. today. todd: these numbers. we have both been through this ed and obviously rachel was literally just in it when u. get these numbers early usually a harbinger of not good things going forward. ed: they have been telling us at least 25 people brought to a hospital there this n. south carolina. remind me a little bit of another major crash march 12th 20rbgs 15. amtrak 18 traveling here in the northeast corridor between new york and washington  d.c. remember  it was going twice the speed limit of 50 miles per hour. hit a curve around philly. 8 people were killed then. more than 200 injured. we haven't seen a tras crash ths 	large since then. two dead. 50 plus injured. when you get the numbers this early  suggests they are just going through the beginning phase of trying to figure out exactly -- rachel: weed should herewe shoue at 6:30 in the press conference. todd: collided with a csx train you have seen them. think are a major provider of freight services throughout our nation. i'm not diminish mizeing. >> not at all. >> a truck of some sort. this is another freight train  freight trains are big and obviously carry freight which means they have a lot of freight behind them colliding with an amtrak train and does beg the question. i know this is early at 6:02 on a sunday. why? happening? train service has been around since the 1800s. you have think we would have figured it out by now. rachel: goes a little faster 	tfaster. todd: true. rachel: going from new york to miami and this happening in casey  south carolina. ed: red cross. i was checking with the nbc national safety board twitter page and they have not updated anything. breaking as we speak. the last thing they tweeted about was the super bowl and getting somewhere safely to either get to the game or watch it at a friend's house. this is something now that has obviously gotten them into an urgent situation. an emergency situation there are at least 25 people who have been transported to a hospital there in the area of columbia  south carolina  called case. as you mentioned. in the area of columbia where people might know it as you are mentioning a freight train hitting a passenger train is just an awful  awful situation. todd: multiple hospitals being utilize utilize at this pt in that columbia  south carolina area. is that true major city in 	and around case  south carolina. from what we know lead engine did derail as well as some passenger cars. you have to keep that in mind. that implies to me a head on collision. rachel: this happening at around 2:30 this morning. todd: we are just getting these details as you are as well. for those who have been to columbia  south carolina. it is a major city there in south carolina. it does have a university there. so presumably does have a very good hospital as well. again  the injured are being taken to at least two local hospitals in that columbia  south carolina area. again  the train collision did happen in case  south carolina. ed: let me just say i mentioned the ntsb main twitter page not updated. second one i see news room. public relations team now telling us they tweeted this at 5:45 a.m. eastern time ntsb go team launching to investigate today's collision of an amtrak train and csx freight train near 	case  south carolina it updates a lot of the information we have already had. it does show you they are sending a go team. the ntsb trying to get on top of this as quickly as possible. rachel: media briefing 6:25 p.m. about 20 minutes from now. there is a shelter open for passengers. those weren't injured but need a place. todd: 8 crew members on board. for those of you worried about loved ones  this is amtrak train 91. it was traveling from new york to miami. presumably a lot of people are going to be affected by. this that's a pretty wide swath of the country. that's the east coast. ed: told 139 passengers  8 crew members. got to remember the crew members as well. had you mentioned  i think  todd at the beginning that the lead car had derailed. so whoever is in there is somebody obviously being attended to right now or multiple people. and there are obviously fears that these numbers are going to keep climbing. 	rachel: i know from the situation i was in this week that was the fear derailing. derailing is when you have a lot more injuries. todd: i don't mean to keep going back to this experience. but  you know  when it happened to you this week  what's going through your mind at that point in time? rachel: the sound. there is such a powerful sound. and you can imagine as you mentioned we had a garbage truck. this is a freight train. i can't imagine the sound that they are hearing  that they heard  just the confusion. people running up and down the aisles to check and see who else might be injured  what happened. you know  this happened at 2: 30 in the morning. you have to presume some people were probably sleeping. todd: unlike on your train where people are up. rachel: really jolted probably sleeping. very scary situation here. ed: we just learned that a shelter has been put together at pine ridge middle school. so if anybody is in the south carolina area  trying to get a handle on this where victims or passengers may be going  pine ridge middle school. 	we presume that's pretty close to where this crashed happened 2:30 a.m. eastern time. todd: right before christmas horrible timing for a train crash is bad but particularly before christmas. there was that dupont  washington that killed three people. and we saw there  i believe ed mention i had  the train was going 80 miles per hour when it derailed on a curve. speed limit only 30 miles per hour. it is way too early in this train crash to be presuming speed or what was a factor here. but what we do know is the lead car of this amtrak train collided with a csx freighter. as we have mentioned a few times here in the first seven minutes of our coverage. those are two very heavily weighted traveling forces. and  you know  it's almost fortunate and i don't want to  again  dominican mize what happened tdediminishdominid 	this week. train on train consequences can be deadly for presumably at this point people on board. rachel: again  happening at 2:30 in the morning. that means it's dark in the train. people are being jolted from their sleep  trying to find out what's going on. makes it harder when it's dark and cold outside. ed: now  we have got some numbers here and some details just to make sure to recap what we have been telling you. a statement coming in from amtrak. what they are saying is this amtrak train number 91. operating between new york and miami as we noted. came in contact with a csx freight train 2:35 a.m. iron time case  south carolina. the lead engine derailed according to amtrak as well as some passenger cars there were 8 crew members as we noted. approximately 139 passengers. they say there were injuries reported and local authorities are on the scene responding. more information will be provided as available. that is an official statement just coming in to our news room. i was on the amtrak train 	between washington and new york on friday. i mention that only to say this is something we frequently do in the north-northeast corridor. it is very safe. this happens very rarely. and that's why it is a big  big deal. obviously when there are dertsdeaths  there are injuries. there are trains crossing america every day on amtrak and most of them are very safe. we routinely get on them for work  for pleasure and something like this is just shocking. rachel: devastating. todd: what was that? ed: we're getting more information. todd: being rail based freight. you see those cxs trains all over the country. they basically bring the products that that we utilize in america in addition to truckers and ship on the ocean  csx is a huge provider of freight. there is a map so you get a geographical sense so you 	know where cayse is in south carolina. individuals being brought to two hospitals. this is in and around the columbia  area for those not necessarily familiar with south carolina. and so hopefully  hospitals will be enough for the injured. rachel: and a shelter being set up. where did you say ed the shelter was at? ed: at the pine ridge middle school in south carolina in the casey arethekays area -- ca. traveling from new york city down to miami presumably in the winter. some getting some vacation time and all of a sudden this awful  horrible accident. it's looking like it's about 52 degrees but feels like 40 	because of the wind chill there. obviously still very early in the morning. and this happened in the middle of the night. 2:35 a.m. eastern time. people trying to save lives as we speak right now. as we mentioned at least 25 people at a local hospital there. but then others who are not injured  just trying to get to shelter. pine ridge middle school in the area of case  south carolina  is where people need to go. rachel: about 19 or 20 minutes  we will be getting a media briefing so we can get more details from the authorities. todd: trying to find some silver lining with all of this. while i may not have heard of cayse  south carolina  it is in the columbia  south carolina metro area which implies you have a major university there which at thitypically has major medical facility which has major hospitals associated with it these injured should be in good hands. i'm not implying that those of us in the more rural parts of our country aren't. oftentimes if this happens in the middle of nowhere it 	can take a long time to get the injured to a hospital. fortunately if you can say that in this kind of a situation  there are local hospitals rather close by because columbia is a major city will in south carolina. rachel: deputies on the scene right now trying to help those off the train  trying to help those get to the hospital  those that need it. so  yeah  very  very tragic. and you are right. when these kinds of accidents happen in a more rural area  time is of the essence. ed: hearing there might be multiple go teams. i mentioned one before. sheriff's deputies in the area responding to the scene. i'm noticing on social media a lot of people tweeting us that it's pronounced kay-see. we

	todd: we continue with our fox news alert. a train collision in cayse  south carolina  between an amtrak train carrying 147 people and a csks freight train. those injured have been taken to at least two local hospitals in the columbia  south carolina area. specifically happened  a lead engine derailed as well as some passenger cars when that lead engine of the amtrak collided with a csx freight train. we are expecting a briefing from the authorities there in about 15 minutes. ed: we're getting brand new video. we are racking that as we speak. producers are working extra hard and have been doing a fabulous job of getting something that literally happened shortly before we went to air. 	and we have just gotten fresh video out of cayse  south carolina. you are obviously seeing still photos now. we are turning that video  you will see in a moment. first look at what is happening on the scene. here's what we can tell you about what we know about what federal officials are trying to do to get to that scene. here's the new video. you can see it right now. it's obviously dark. on the east coast here  looking out the window here at new york city it's still pretty dark as well. this is the winter time  obviously. very cold here. we have seen it's maybe in the 40's or 50's. not as bad in south carolina as people try to get to shelter at what we're told is the pine ridge middle school in the cayse  south carolina area. that video shot a little bit from the distance. emergency personnel trying to get to the scene. and the nbc ntsb. the national transportation safety board who tries to get to incidents like this rachel you know that very well having just been through a horrible incident 	a few days ago in virginia. the ntsb says they are launching a go team to investigate this collision of an amtrak train going from here in new york city down to miami  florida and colliding with a csx freight train near cayse  south carolina. rachel: this accident happening around 2:30 in the morning. sleeper cars. very frightening situation. trying to find safety and gather with loved ones to the middle school  the pine ridge middle school. those who weren't taken to the hospital and those who needed shelter  that's where they are going. the pine ridge middle school. and we know authorities  lots of authorities  can you see from that video seems to be a lot of help there trying to help those. ed: sheriff deputies and others trial to respond. first responders  easy to forget about this. in incidents around the country  not enough people thank our law enforcement  our first responders who in 	the middle of the night getting quie ready for a quiet weekend  the super bowl in a few hours. you kant see much in that video  but  what can you see is clearly sirens with people responding. in fact  i believe right now on the telephone we have the chief of public information for south carolina emergency management derek becker. we appreciate you joining us right now. can you please tell us  everybody in the fox news audience  what you know about the situation  sir. >> yes  sir. well  as you might expect  we're still getting information still coming in. can confirm at least two facilities  lexington county has confirmed two fatalities and at least 70 people transport to the hospital with nonlife threatening injuries at this point. we have established a shelter i think that was mentioned before at one of the nearby middle schools for all the passengers who are on board the train. now  if there is anybody who has -- they have loved ones on this train they can 	actually get information from amtrak directly by calling 1-800-523-9101. of course the focus is on the safety of everybody that was on board that train. everybody has what they need to stay warm. we are expecting them to be a little cold. even cold for south carolina. and so  right now  we're making sure they have a warm place to stay at the shelter while we clear the scene. todd: 91 for families who might be concerned about families traveling from new york to miami. correct? >> right. anybody with any questions involving the passengers on amtrak train 91 can call 1-800-523-9101. todd: do we know what the items were in the csx train? >> we believe at this point it was diesel. 	todd: when it's a diesel situation  do you have hazmat on scene. >> absolutely. just to make sure everybody is safe. hazmat crews. everything is safe at this point. there is no danger to anyone in the nearby area of lexington county of cayse  of pine ridge it actually happened about a mile away from the south carolina state emergency operation center. so  we're functioning in sort of a supporting role for those local first responders and making sure that they -- if they need any resources  we can get it to them very quickly. ed: derrec  thi this is ed henry we have rachel campos duffy as well. you confirm that we had heard there were two dead you raised the number from 50 injured to at least 70. i want to ask you a little bit more about that. it sounded like some positive news that i want to 	pass along and i want to reiterate that you say out of the at least 70 injured  all or most were nonlife threatening injuries? >> that's correct. and that was new information that we got from lexington county. obviously numbers like that  total numbers can change when you have a very active and ongoing incident like this. report are anything from cuts and scrapes  we do have some reports of a couple of broken bones. but  at this point  nonlife threatening injuries. todd: mr. becker  we are being told by our producers who are getting this information  of course  through their various source thafers some of the cars are so badly damaged that police are having difficulty getting to people inside those cars. is that accurate? >> that's one of the things that we're trying to determine at this point. like i said before  it's still a very active and ongoing scene. we are attempting to ascertain and make sure we have gotten everybody off the train. it's possible that there could be additional information  a little bit later from now. we are doing a media 	briefing in about 10 minutes. so  i need to run real quick so we have the most up to date information. ed: we appreciate it derek becker with south carolina emergency management. we understand he has more important things to do. getting information out is important but tending to those with injuries and getting to the bottom of the situation. we appreciate his time. we will try to reestablish with him. rachel: diesel  he mentioned diesel. that browft alarm to me. i know in the crash i was in this week the train crash i was in the amtrak train crash  that was a big concern. they could smell gas and they were worried about explosions. good to hear that they said they have what they. ed: hazmat team. you are right. we want to pass on positive news u.s. not just deaths and not exaggerate the situation more injuries than anticipated. we heard 25 sent to a hospital. then we heard at least 50 injured. now that number climbing to 	over 70 injured. on the upo positive side at least. we are hearing in early reports  and this can change  these are initial reports. that most or all of those 70 hurt have minor journalist. nonlife threatening. he was mentioning derrec becker did some cuts and scrapes. broken bones. we don't want to minimize it but hopefully not a climb in the number killed. rachel: he also mentioned and you brought that up  ed  that they were having trouble accessing some of the passengers because of the damage to the car. one of the things i was really impressed with this past week in my experience was how professional amtrak was. they went up and down the isles multiple times trying to make sure there was not passenger injured and possibly left behind. they were checking and double-checking and triple checking that. ed: that's a great point. you can see from the video wee have shown from a moment ago it's still dark there  cayse  south carolina. two dead  more than 70 injured. we are told most of those nonlife threatening. 	amtrak train number 91. if you have a family member or friend who might have been traveling between new york and miami. obviously  there is a lot of stops there in between  so  got to czech the ticket. got to figure out who might have been there. but amtrak train 91 collided with a csx freight train carrying diesel fuel 2:35 a.m. eastern. todd: there is humanity to this situation. these are loved ones on the train. we just got news moments ago that everyone is off the train. so that is a little good news. however  if you think that your relative is on amtrak train 91  the phone number to call for information is 1-800-523-9101: keep in mind these individuals that were injured  the 70 that ed and rachel have mention have had been taken to local hospitals in the columbia  south carolina area. which is about five minutes  five miles  i should say 	there in lexington county from where this train did derail. again  the number on your screen  if you think you may have loved ones that are involved. rachel: the rest of the passengers who are not injured  they are being taken to pine ridge middle school. remember  they are stranded. they have nowhere to go. it's dark. it's in the middle of the night. they were probably on the way to vacation. ed: they may not be from this local area. some people may be getting off near here and may have family that can drive there and go get them to safety to pick them up. others originating here from here in new york city or may have been returning home to miami there is a lot of stops  obviously  up and down the eastern seaboard. we are going to take a break in a few seconds here as we reset this because we want to get back real quickly to this news briefing. we just spoke with derek becker in south carolina emergency management. two dead. at least 70 injured. on the positive side at least of those 70 injured 	they believe to have nonlife threatening injuries. we will hear more from the officials right after this break. ♪ ♪ when you combine ancestry's dna test with its historical

around"
"16",2018-02-04 07:00:00,"2:35 a.m. this morning. we believe that there was diesel in the csx train. at least that's what one of the police who called in earlier told us. lead engine derailed as some well as some passenger cars. 8 crew members. 139 passengers. two fatalities. 70 people in the hospital. or most are nonthreatening injuries. shelter for passengers is open at pine ridge middle school. if you believe that you have a family member who might have been on that amtrak train  amtrak has provided a phone number and that's 1-800-523-9101. ed: we're just hearing from the red cross  by the way that they have established sight. we had mentioned earlier they were headed there but they are now at that pine ridge middle school trying to help out. we have had this fresh video you can see from the lexington ledger. it doesn't show a lot because it's still dark here in the east as it is in  of course  all around the 	country as you are just waking up  getting this horrible news. this tragedy. two people killed at least 70 hurt. we are at least hearing from decker becker who you mentioned a moment ago  rachel from the south carolina emergency management team was kind enough to hop on the phone and say out of those 70 hurt. they believe most or all are nonlife threatening emergencies. cuts and scrapes  some broken bones. don't want to manipulate mize it obviously still very serious. but we are hoping that that number on the left of the screen in terms of the number killed is not going to climb. todd: hazmat team on scene to deal with the diesel that was in the csx train and set the geo graphic call seen for you where this happened. cayse  south carolina. borders in richland counties in that general area. columbia  south carolina is the main city in and around this region. that is fortunate. in a situation like  this because presumably the 	university of south carolina has a robust medical staff there. multiple hospitals to deal with a population center like columbia  south carolina. also  a research hospital should have some of the best doctors in and around the south carolina area there. so those injured albeit with nonlife threatening injuries according to public information officer derek becker. they should presumably be getting the best of care and quickly because it's only about five miles from columbia  south carolina. ed: and  in fact  there is going to be a news briefing any moment. we want to assure you are that the fox news team here up bright and early on this sunday is monitoring that situation. it's the office of emergency management within the state of south carolina that we will be holding that briefing. they initially said about this time. about 6:30 a.m. eastern time. as you can understand under the circumstances they are trying to collect as much information as they can save as many lives  get the situation stabilized with the diesel fuel that todd just mentioned. so that's -- those are their priorities. 	but then they want to let the public know because there is  you know  139 passengers as you mentioned  8 crew members. a lot of people in the winter time are going between new york and miami  florida. vacations. there are other people who have jobs up and down the east coast. but there could be a lot of families that are traveling. rachel: or elderly people on the train as well. you have to imagine  i mean  this is happening in the middle of the night. 2:35 in the morning there are no seat belts on amtrak train. being awaken with a jolt. the sound is just scaring. todd: you were on one. three since december. three derailments. rachel: you said this was with csx  that means this was a huge impact. sound was very loud. todd: we don't know where the individuals killed were from. were they on the csx train? were they passengers on the amtrak train? obviously we're going to get details. keep in mind  this collision happened less than four 	hours ago teams responding to the scene as quickly as possible. it's great information that as we know at this point everybody is out of the damaged train. so  some good news at this point in time. we had earlier reports that police were having difficulty getting to some cars because they sorp badly damaged. but the latest update like we just said  everybody is out of the train cars involved in this collision. ed: obviously they still could be searching. they say that in the initial reports. looking out the window here in new york city. it's still very dark. you can see the light there some of that siren. some emergency management lights being brought in to get people to shelter. get people to safety as quickly as they can. we always have to remember that initial reports can change as an investigation unfolds  so the numbers can go up. the numbers can go down in terms of numbers injured or killed. rachel: so good to look on the bright side. again  only 70 people hurt. all minor injuries. there was no explosion. they hit a diesel. 	ed: a truck  pardon me  a freight train fuel of diesel fuel as you say  rachel  this could have been far  far worse. already tragic with two killed and many injured but with diesel fuel in that freight train presumably traveling at high speed  this could have been a lot  lot worse. >> todd: in your experience on trains guys  do they slow them down at this late hour overnight or speed them up? rachel: that's one of the questions we are going to have how fast was this train going? todd: people sleeping. one of those things where the speed they just zip through? ed: i know we learned from the incident in 2015 which i remember very well because at the time this was happening between new york and washington. and it was amtrak train 188. and we have learned from this situation that incident 	that the speed limit  at least in that area  was 50 miles per hour. and as it entered a sharp curve  around the philadelphia area  that was back in may 015  that amtrak train was traveling at twice the speed limit. todd: right. ed: that's why it derailed and that's why you ended up having 8 people killed and more than 200 injured. obviously sparked all kinds of investigations and whatnot. so when you ask about the speed  i remember from that incident that the speed limit at least in that part of the northeast corridor is supposed to be 50 miles per hour. we have to get more information. and we hope to have this briefing any moment there in south carolina. cayse  ace mentioned  right near columbia  south carolina. and the emergency management team there is trying to get on top of this situation. they seem in the early moments  early hours  to be doing just that. and when we had derek becker hop on the phone just a few moments ago  he seemed like he and his colleagues were getting on top of the 	situation. rachel: obviously. those not injured taken to the hospital being taken to the pine ridge middle school. obviously these people are traveling on vacation or whatever. and have no place to go. it's in the middle of the night or at least the early hours of the morning. ed: if you had not heard us earlier  amtrak has given limited information so far. they obviously  in fairness  they are trying to get on top of this situation. they have a phone number  1-hundred-523-9101. if you believe you have a family member  a relative. you see it right there on the screen. shelter for passengers at the pine ridge middle school as rachel mentioned. we believe from the initial reports that all passengers are now off that train. rachel: although they did have trouble getting to passengers because there was so much damage. ed: in the initial hours. remember  we are now four hours into this. it happened about 2:35 a.m. eastern time just after 6:37 a.m. eastern time. now here in the east we expect the news conference any moment. 	you are going to want to stick here because we are trying to get this information to you as quickly as possible. todd: key element to keep in mind. this happened at 2:30 a.m. what were you doing at 2:30 a.m. in the morning. likely sleeping. the people on the train were in all likelihood sleeping as well. as well as the first responders. can you imagine in a situation like this where it is a major train collision  yes  all first responders have people on stand by sunday morning at 2:30 in the morning. but a number of people had to get woken up out of bed to rush to a scene that fortunately is relatively close to a major city  at least for south carolina there in columbia  south carolina. looking at the pictures right now  there is an intense response from first responders. keep in mind this is not right next to knox where have you hundreds of people ready to go at a moment's notice. it does seem like a pretty 	robust response at least looking at these pictures. ed: third amtrak crash since december. rachel knows that. this is the second one. virginia area on the way from washington  d.c. and west virginia for the republican retreat. rachel: that's right. for the republican retreat. in that case the train was going 67 miles per hour. the speed limit was 60 miles per hour. so you mentioned earlier  another train crash. ed: where the speed limit was 55 miles per hour around philadelphia  very busy part for amtrak in the northeast corridor and it was going twice that speed. todd: at this point in time i know a number of people when they hear. let's call it what it is it is a mass casualty incident. although fortunately it does appear for the 70 people injured they are relatively minor injuries. of course  in this day and age where do our minds go initially? 	it goes to fierce of terrorism and things of that nature. we have received no information that this is anything other than a collision between two trains. obviously in a situation like this  four ours in  we are working our sources to find out the very latest information. at this point in time it does appear to be a train collision. when you everywhere on the train this week that was your initial instinct. rachel: right. you hear that sound. obviously we have had very intense political season. we have had attacks on republicans shootings. obviously we are on a train full of congress. can i imagine that sound amplified for these four passengers this morning because they hit a freight train. and you have to wonder why are two trains on the same track? there is going to be a lot of questions about the speed. about that question. hopefully we will get some answers. ed: we do hope to get those answers. we are hearing four the podium is being set up and 	there is some movement there in the area of cayse  south carolina where the emergency management team  state emergency management team will  in fact  be holding a news conference literally any moment now. we will go there live as soon as we see those members of the team there is a microphone we are told that's now been added can i see it right there. the left of the scene. the right of the scene is there are some people walking towards the microphone. it has not quite yet started yet as you can see. we want to go there as soon as they do start speaking. we spoke earlier to derek becker who is with that emergency management team in south carolina. he gave us some very important information which is that initially we had heard that there were about 25 people rushed to a hospital maybe around 50 who 	were injured. and it looks like someone is ready talk attachment. >> information. thumb's up when you are ready okay. good. okay. good? >> i'm going to very briefly just number one thank you for coming out this morning and especially under these circumstances. my name is derec becker with the south carolina emergency management situation. we are supporting lexington county with whatever they may need. any facilities or any sort of resources that a local first responders may need or that amtrak even might need  we are here. we have not activated the state emergency operation center in terms of a full activation lining like you are used to. we do have a limited crew. i am going to give you very 	briefly the run down of who is going to speak largsson kay hill public information officer for lexington county. then captain adam myric and langley from the red cross. i will turn it directly over to harrison. >> good morning  everybody. just give you a brief statement on what we have got going on here. lexington county emergency management as well as their fire service and e.m.s. responded to the charleston highway  pine ridge intersection in reference to a train derailment. at about 2:45 this morning  when we arrived on scene  we immediately began assessing the situation. what we found was two different trains with passenger train and a freight train that collided. what we immediately went into was a search mode. search and rescue mode. we were able to begin to extract and assist passengers off of that train. at this time all passengers are off of the train. that is very important to 	put out there. unfortunately  there were two fatalities as a result of this collision. we are working with the coroner's office here in lexington county very closely with that. at this time we have transported about 70 patients with various injuries to local area hospitals. one thing that i would like to point out is the extreme cooperation between all of the entities you see here. including the list goes on  including city of columbia  rich land county  fort jackson  sert  all of those have been moving in this operation to assist to make sure all of this is taken care of appropriately. i will go ahead and turn it over to captain adam myrick. and tell you about their agencies involved in this incident. >> good morning  i' m last name myrick. here to tell you a little bit about our role in this response this morning. 	we are on scene making sure that that scene remains secure. that is really the top foe consultation of our units that are near the crash site to make sure the scene remains secure. that means everyone can then work as they need to. the first responders will be safe there and we are working alongside all of the agencies that are here. as mr. kay hill mentioned there are a number of them. we are also teaming one state troopers to control traffic in the area. we have some traffic checkpoints  not checkpoints but traffic control points that we are also working  making sure that we have the proper access and those who need to access the site can get there those who don't quite just yet  we are keeping those at a location and at a safe distance  so we as first responders can do our work. something else the deputies have done here in the last hour or so is we have transported those who are not injured to the reception 	site. so we know that they're shaken up quite a bit. we know this is unlike anything else they have ever been through. we wanted to get them out of the cold. out of the weather. get them to a warm place. we have transported them in our units to the reception site  which is going to be opened up by the american red cross. with that i will turn it over to langley from the american red cross to tell you about the operation there at the reception site. >> good morning  everybody. my name is cuthbert  langley. langley. spokes personal for the red cross. we are opening up that reception center at pine ridge middle school. we have a dozen volunteers or staff on their way here or here right now. staff members and volunteers are coming from across the state to assist with this effort. we have emergency response vehicle that's coming as well that will be at the reception site to provide water and snacks and those sorts of things. we are going to continue to 	work with the government partners you see up here with first responders and assist them as the investigation and as the day progresses. again  the red cross is going to be here for as long as needed. we will step n any way that we are asked to help. today is a tragic day for some people and the red cross will be here for as long as we are needed. thank you. >> all right. at this time any questions? >> any road blocks at this point. >> right now the only road blocks would be pine ridge drive. the one that runs right here next to emd all wait down to 321. >> can you characterize the 70 injuries? >> i will let harrison take care of that for you. >> sir  the 70 injuries range obviously in variety. anything from small scratches and bumps to more severe broken bones. so they kind of run the gamut in between that. >> are they nonlife threatening. >> at this time i don't have that information but i can get that information. >> can you go over again the basics of what happened here? 	i wasn't here at the very beginning  just so i have some details what happened this morning? >> yeah. so there was a train collision and derailment near charleston highway and pine ridge drive between a freight train and a passenger train. when we arrived on scene  we began assisting passengers off of that train. at this time there are no passengers on the train. it's very important to put that out. there were about 70 passengers that were transported to local area hospitals for various injuries. there were two fatalities according to the lexington county coroner's office. that has been confirmed. and right now we are also asking people that if they have any concerns or want more information to call amtrak info line. that number is 1-800-523-9101. again that's the amtrak info line. 	1-800-523-9101. >> fatalities. >> at this point i don't have that information. that will probably come out either from csx or lexington county coroner's office. >> do you have any idea how fast the trains were traveling. >> no. at this point no. we just know they collided on the tracks. >> any idea why they collided? >> not at this time. that will be up to the investigation of csx and the ntsb. >> hazardous materials on the csx train. >> there was about -- our hazmat team did respond. we were able to secure two leaks of fuel from the trains. right now we are estimating about 5 000 gallons of fuel has spilled. we have called in dehec and csx's deheck team to secure that cleanin leak and we're asss as much as we can. >> no threat to the public at this time. >> no threat to the public at this time. >> derek  i'm sure every year you guys -- 2005 -- any 	time you hear of a train wreck that immediately comes to mind. can you talk about the amount of training that goes into. >> this is not our first train derailment. you mentioned the incident in 2005. this is nothing like that. unfortunately we have many more people who were affected directly by this incident. it's unfortunate that we have two fatalities. our hearts are with those families right now. we want to make schumer right now the focus is on the passengers on that train  that they have some place warm that any unmet needs that they may have that those are being attended to. but we do have extensive training. working with our local first responders and our county emergency managers in terms of who calls who? where do you go to get resources? how can we reach out to any of the train companies and so forth? so  you're absolutely right. it's something we look at every sing dwell year. >> okay. anything else? >> anything the public can do to help at this point? >> right now stay away from this area. if you were going to come to pine ridge for whatever 	reason  might be best to delay your trip or your plans for the next couple of hours. if there's anything that any information  call that amtrak number that harrison just gave. if there is anything that we can do or any information that you might need  especially if you have a loved one who was on board that train  call that telephone number and harrison can give it right here directly in just a minute. okay? >> how is it going to impact traffic flow? certain area that's cordoned off. >> fortunately  this is a relatively low trask area in terms of especially on a sunday. highway 321 traffic impairment will be minimal. >> can you talk about i guess the span of wreckage? quarter mile? half a mile. >> that's one of the things we are trying to determine and get more information for you. we have that type of thing and especially in regards to what the ntsb is doing. what amtrak will be doing. that will all come out a little bit later. we will try to have another 	briefing as we have more information. this will be the joint information area the media briefing area. any official information about this incident will come from right here. of course  you guys telephone numbers. if anything comes up  give us a call  okay? thank you very much. todd: all right. back here in new york. you are looking at pictures right there. we are just hearing from derek becker the public information officer in that area to discuss the specifics of what just happened. as we know at this point  two people are dead  70 people hurt in a collision between an amtrak train  train number 91. and a csx train. there were a few things from that news conference that stood out to me. they don't know where the fatals are from. leading to 5 000 gallons spilled no. threats to the public at this time. this is a little bit contradictory to what we 	heard earlier. when harrison cahill  the state emergency management division  they didn't know whether there were no life threatening injuries. he said they would look into it. we do know of scrapes and broken bones. but when asked are you officially saying there are no life threatening injuries he? couldn't answer that. rachel: he can't answer that because if you are on blood thinners and you break your leg  that is life-threatening injury. todd: great point. rachel: that's something we thought about often. a small injury for somebody on medication could become very serious. listen  this happened at 2:35 in the morning  todd. they hit a diesel freight freezing rain. there are no seat belts on a train. people had to have been thrown from their seats and jolted in a very powerful way. ed: yeah. also officials saying they do not have info on speed. in terms of how fast either train was traveling either the passenger train or the 	freight train. they do not have information yet on why they collided. obviously that's going to be the focus of their investigation. the officials in lexington county  who started this news conference saying that they responded within 10 minutes  about 2:45 a.m. eastern time. and that they imimmediately went into search and rescue mode. they were able to get everybody off the trains as we heard. two deaths. about 70 injuries. still getting a handle on that. and i think that's remarkable. two leaks of fuel. 5 000 gallons of diesel fuel we were told has spilled and  yet  they say that they have secured it  at least for now  and that the public is safe. that is something obviously everybody in that area is going to be paying close attention to. rachel: thank god for the red cross. i felt so good when i heard that gentleman talking from the red cross saying we have taken everybody out. we are making sure they are not cold. taking them to pine ridge middle school where they are right now. getting them snacks. making them warm and feel 	comfortable. you have to imagine this was a traumatic experience for them. ed: we will be following this along with a lot of other stories this morning. todd: with that we will take a very quick commercial break. more information  the latest on the deadly train collision in south carolina when ""fox & friends"" sunday returns. ♪ ♪ g bonus check every six months i'm accident free. and i don't

sunday morning. todd: out of south carolina  two people dead. 70 more injured after amtrak train collision and derailment in south carolina. the amtrak train heading from new york to miami derailing in cayse outside of columbia  south carolina. 139 passengers. 8 crew members on board. police end ago news conference moments ago. take a listen. >> 70 injuries in variety anything from small crashes and bumps to more severe broken bones. ed: you can see from this picture some of the train cars knocked off the tracks. all passengers are now off the train  we're told. some heading to a nearby middle school for shelter. rachel: the nbc are on scene and we'll bring you the latest details as we get them. he haded what he really shock me more than anything  obviously two people dying  horrific. rachel: yeah. 	on top of that  70 injured. but when you hear the officials say at this news conference a couple moments ago that 5 000 gallons of fuel spilled out because this was a freight train with diesel fuel 8 crew members. 139 passengers. they say they have it secure and people in the local area are safe. this could have gotten a lot worse. rachel: that's what i call a miracle that nothing exploded that we have as few injuries as we have. although they are very tragic. i felt from the news conference very confident that these officials had things under control and so happy to hear that the red cross was working to milwaukee those involved in the crash comfortable at the middle school. todd: you literally just experienced a train crash this week. rachel: dierks of course. not on the scale of this which makes my heart go out even more to those who 	obviously lost their lives but those who experience this. it's very scary. this happening at 2:35 in the morning. they are probably sleeping. there are no seat belts on trains. jolted from their sleep. worried about their loved ones. dark at night. ed: cold. rachel: very scary experience for them. very scary. ed: traveling from new york city to miami  florida. this is something that obviously happens a lot in the winters in terms of people heading south. trying to get to the warmer climate. rachel: of course. ed: people starting a new week. the local officials jumped on this very quickly. they said within 10 minutes of the collision they had the emergency management team on the scene. todd: in case you are just waking up  learning about this train collision in south carolina and wondering about your family members  there is a phone number to call it is 1-800-523-9101. 	that's the number to call to find out more. this was amtrak train 91. you see the stats up there on your scene. two dead  about 70 injured there is a shelter for passengers open at the pine ridge middle school. again  the key point that we want to reiterate. all passengers are off the train at this point in time. those 70 injured have been taken to hospitals in and around the columbia  south carolina area. two hospitals in particular. but  again  if you think you have a loved one on that train  please call that amtrak number. ed: obviously super sunday. you have a super bowl today. this puts things into perspective and to focus very  very quickly. football game palg in comparison to people fighting for their lives. two people losing their lives. 70 injured. the initial report suggest that those 70 injured have relatively minor injuries  cuts and scrapes. but as rachel mentioned 	earlier  you simply don't know. a broken bone for an elderly person is different than for an 18-year-old. they have to -- they have officials at the hospital working through all of this trying to keep those numbers down and get everybody safe. rachel: those numbers climbing. initially we thought 20-some injured. then it 50  and then it went to 70. that's what happens when you get early reports. todd: at this point in time we don't know where those fatalities came from. whether they were the people on the amtrak train or crsk freighter. we keep coming back to 5 000 gallons of diesel spilled. hazmat teams on the scene right now evaluating the situation but telling us that there is no threat to the public at this point in time. ed: officials saying they don't know how fast either train was going. that will be a focus of the investigation. they don't know the key question which is why did they collide? rachel: they secured the area. that's one of the things 	that the captain myrick from the sheriff's department let us know they have absolutely secured the area. they have gotten everybody off the train. i can tell you from my experience this week amtrak was very procialg after that crash going up and down double  triple checking to make sure that nobody was left hibsd. ed to these are brand new images just in to fox news of the train collision there in cayse  south carolina. for those of you who may not be familiar with that area it is about five miles from columbia  south carolina. as we have been mentioning throughout the morning that is fortuitous in this kind of a situation because university of south carolina is there. medical facilities. all the levels of trauma center that you would need in a situation like this at the ready because of the proximity to columbia  south carolina. i know i did not know about kazee  south carolina  prior to the last two hours here fortuitous that it is in that general area so close to a major university and city. ed: i just got a note from one of our viewers who said 	he ran a locomotive 10 years and big question whyy the trains on the track at the same time. was it a faulty switch in did the train pick the switch? was the switch thrown against them or was someone negligent? obviously this is what the nbc anntsb and others will be doing to investigate. what is he also saying in terms of keeping the casualties down  he said hopefully the freight train knocked the much lighter built passenger train off the rails instead of actually going through it. which would have obviously been a much more horrific tragedy. todd: subject upsumming up  at t two people dead and 70 injured between amtrak train and csx freighter carrying diesel fuel. those injured have been taken to two local hospitals to be evaluated at this point in time. we know those injuries appear to be scrapes up to broken bones. as we have mentioned a broken bone for some person can be a life-threatening injury. we don't want to say 	everybody is completely off the hook at this point. the scene there under control. no -- the hazmat team is there but there is no concern for the public or the diesel spilled that we will keep you posted on. ed: we mentioned the ntsb is sending a go team there. we will see whether the president has anything to say about this fema or other federal officials get involved here. the ntsb sending a go team helps get this under control so it's not like the entire federal government has to jump on it in the meantime  the president has also over the last 24 hours been tweeting about the story that had been dominating the headlines before all of this is that republican fisa memo that has taken an already volatile situation in terms of all of the russia investigations and blown it up even more and the president pretty much feeling like he has been and i have indicatevindindicated bye memo released on fridays. president pointing out it 	points out the disturbing fact that the fbi and fisa appear to be used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath. the fbi failed continue to form the fisa court that the clinton camp had funded the dossier. the fbi became a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy. and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law. the fbi wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators. the president add allege line there that he was quoting a story in the ""wall street journal"" about all of this. you can see what's instantly happening. the ""new york times"" full story today suggesting that the president is attacking law enforcement anti-law enforcement. we are going to get into that. ed: the president is pushing back and change the narrative. rachel: this memo vindicates all the things i have been saying. important to note the information we got from the fisa memo is significant 	because even the very lowest level agent at the fbi that you never would use opposition research paid for by the opposing party as evidence for a fisa warrant to spy on an american. on a presidential campaign and on a sitting president. this is very serious stuff. and i think it's really foundational to who we are. we are not a police state. and it's interesting that democrats are saying you are undermining the fbi. adam schiff great article in the ""wall street journal"" about that. he was somebody who used to be very concerned about the abuse of fisa warrants. he has changed his tuna little bit. todd: we want to listen to a sound bite from donald trump jr. on the vindication and we will go into more detail. take a listen. >> there is a little bit of sweet revenge in for me and probably the family in a sense that if they wouldn't have done this  this stuff would be going on. this would be going on at the highest levels of 	government. they would be continuing to do it to my father. trying to undermine his actions. imagine how effective he can be given the year he has had without this cloud over his head. i want them to come. but come to a conclusion already. have you been looking for two years. have you come up with nothing other than their own nefarious actions and their own collusions. they have come up with nothing. so  at this point  you got to come to something. like just come to something. todd: with that as the back drop. weave asked so many of our guests yesterday the $64 000 question. should this be the end of the russia investigation? quite frankly  rachel  there is a split amongst republicans. the number of republicans say this should be the end of it individuals like trey gowdy no  let bob mueller finish what he started. ed: yeah  absolutely. saying this is bad for the fbi. this is bad for the justice department but that does not necessarily mean that the mueller investigation has been tainted. and have you republicans like trey gowdy saying that and beings very direct about that. we're going to talk to jason 	chaffetz. former colleague of trey gowdy and some of these other republicans like devin nunes who have been in the middle of all of this in just a couple minutes. rachel: absolutely. right now we are going to turn to your headlines. christian broadcasting network founder pat robertson recovering after suffering from a stroke. a family member rushing the 87-year-old televangelist to a hospital in virginia after recognizing symptoms. robertson hosts cbn's flag ship show the 700 club where he interviewed president

minneapolis star tribune  however  prince's friends and family say this would be against the late music legend wishes. todd: i know timberlake is talented but i didn't know he could raise the dead.

""new york times"" trump's unparalleled war on a pillar of society  law enforcement. politico  trump escalates his war with u.s. law enforcement after memo release. and ""the washington post "" once the party of law and order  republicans are now challenging it. rachel: fox news contributor jason chaffetz is former chairman of the oversight and government reform committee and he joins us now. so  jason  what do you think of that? is donald trump and now so many republicans damaging the reputation of the fbi or just talking about the leadership that's corrupt? >> >> good morning. donald trump didn't create this mess but is he here to 	help clean it up. anybody to reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system. and  you know  all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats this was an attack on law enforcement and this is going to dismantle our security apparatus  this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true. none of it. and how ironic in the movie theaters right now have you meryl streep and tom hanks in a move touting the post about how they would print everything and want to get everything out there and now all of a sudden we are trying to expose the truth and what happens they get attacked as saying -- no  donald trump is as pro-law enforcement as any president we have had in my lifetime. and is he trying to clean it up. ed: jason  where do we go from here? because you know and have you been sounding the alarm on this sooner than a lot of people saying yeah  this memo is important. pay attention to the justice 	department inspector general report which may be coming just weeks from now and is going to have more revelations about the fbi  about the justice department. i presume a lot of these attacks in the mainstream media and democrats like adam schiff are only going to increase. what say you about the way forward here in terms of pushing back on that but also actually fixing some of this? >> the inspector general the request that came from me in my office. everything from the james comey firing all the way through the tarmac meeting between loretta lynch and president clinton and all the other things that have happened in between. michael horowitz  450 employees  the inspector general at the department of justice. he has been looking at this. they have been silent. they have been quiet. you haven't heard leaks of this. there was a concern about the text messages between strzok and page. they presented that to mr. mueller. mueller immediately made a change. i think that would be a key indicator that there was 	some real wrong going there mueller looks at it  dismisses the guy. meanwhile he was embedded as the number two person at the fbi. a lot happening. but the inspector general is very important. devin nunes andth intel committee will come out with more reports. it's bigger and broader unfortunately than just the fbi. he mentioned the state department. i think you will see a look at the intelligence community as well. todd: jason  all week we heard the release of this memo is going to endanger national security. the sky is going to fall. we are all going to be dead once this thing is released. still  even though the release has happened and everybody has had time to look and see that there really is no national security imoccasion. we have had numerous experts on here to tell us that the democrats and many in the liberal media are still saying there is a national security issue. but not pointing to any facts. can you help us out? are there any facts there that maybe the three of us are missing? >> adam schiff and the democrats on that committee 	were flailing this was going to destroy the security apparatus. as soon as it comes out democrats changed their talking points and said it's a nothing burger. there is nothing here to see. it doesn't mean anything. you can't have it both ways  folks. you are reading the same memo before and after and you took two paths and you are just misdirecting from the key fact that name names and were very specific within that report. now it's four pages in a massive investigation. but it does illuminate the major systemic problems there at the fbi. rachel: jason  i feel like the president has been pretty clear in some of his tweets that he was separating the leadership  which he thinks has been corrupt and biceed from the rank and file fbi. have you heard from any members of the fbi and members in your community that they feel that separation? even john mccain has came out and said you are damaging the reputation. you are hurting the morale of the fbi. and you are saying clean it 	are already changing because of it. that's coming up next. hi  i'm bob harper  and i recently had a heart attack. it changed my life. but i'm a survivor. after my heart attack  my doctor prescribed brilinta. it's for people who have been hospitalized for a heart attack. brilinta is taken with a low-dose aspirin. no more than 100 milligrams as it affects how well brilinta works. brilinta helps keep platelets from sticking together and forming a clot. in a clinical study  brilinta worked better than plavix. brilinta reduced the chance of having another heart attack... 	...or dying from one. don't stop taking brilinta without talking to your doctor  since stopping it too soon increases your risk of clots in your stent  heart attack  stroke  and even death. brilinta may cause bruising or bleeding more easily  or serious  sometimes fatal bleeding. don't take brilinta if you have bleeding  like stomach ulcers  a history of bleeding in the brain  or severe liver problems. slow heart rhythm has been reported. tell your doctor about bleeding new or unexpected shortness of breath any planned surgery  and all medicines you take. if you recently had a heart attack  ask your doctor if brilinta is right for you. my heart is worth brilinta. if you can't afford your medication  astrazeneca may be able to help. 	ed: we are back with a fox news alert we have been following all morning. brand new picture coming in the newsroom train crash in south carolina killed two people and injuring at least 70. police say injuries vary between scratches  bruises and broken bones. the amtrak train was heading from right here in new york city to miami. derailing in cayse  just outside of columbia  south carolina. 139 passengers. 8 crew members were on board. some of the train cars knocked off the tracks all together. all passengers are off the train now. some heading to a nearby middle school for shelter. 	the nbc and re ntsb and red croe on the scene. we will bring you the latest details as we get them. todd? todd: all right  ed  thank you very much. president trump touting the real impacts of his tax reform bill. take a listen. >> roughly three million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker and that's just over the past six weeks alone. todd: take a look at this headline from the associated press reading. tax bill beginning to deliver bigger paychecks to workers. joining us now  one of those seeing a bigger paycheck  lee and shirley ann do you pray and also joining us cpa pointers on how to use your if youly found money. lee  i want to begin with you. if you don't mind  i don't mean to get too personal here. can you tell us how much money you are seeing in your paycheck? >> a little over $49 a week. todd: tell me what that means to you living in connecticut right now? >> oh  as we all know  we are one of the higher taxed 	states. many factors. last fall i had cancer surgery so i'm a cancer survivor. i have medical bills to pay. so every little bit makes a huge business. todd: have you enjoyed your husband quote unquote crumbs to quote nancy pelosi. >> i always enjoy any dollar increase in paycheck. thanks trump and thanks republicans  we will take it. todd: if i'm not mistaken you are currently looking for work  correct? >> yes. todd: last year you tried and were only able to get one interview. >> in person. todd: now you say because of the tax reform that president trump pushed through  you are seeing a lot more action  a lot more interviews this year. >> very much. so the week after he signed that i got my first in person interview and then two weeks ago i got three in one week. todd: wow  that's a lot. >> i have been able to apply to several jobs this past week there has been more 	jobs available. todd: add more color to this all three of us living in connecticut. it's not chock-full of jobs right now. to be able to get that it shows that the president trump tax plan is even working in the nutmeg state. >> very much  yeah. todd: tell us how you are usersing the money. >> we are savers  we tend to save and pay down debt. and it doesn't just affect us. it makes it to so we can help our children and grandchildren more it spreads out in all different directions. todd: that's how you folks are handling the money. let's bring in dan right now. daniel  i'm seeing more money in my paycheck. what should i do with that money. >> my advice to people in this situation is first and foremost take down debt. take down expensive debt. particularly credit card bills. you don't want to be paying that high interest rate. point 2 if you have the ability to prepay your mortgage  take advantage of that because you will save big dollars over the long term. if you don't have those scenarios  then i would say 	put money into your retirement plan. it's tax deferred. you get double benefit when you do it that way. todd: explain a little bit more about the exponential effect of chipping away at your mortgage and chipping away at your high interest debt? >> so  when you have a situation here where you are going to be saving $50 a week  and that's obviously between $250 a month. if you start to put that towards your mortgage  you will shorten the amount of mortgage time. 30 year you may over time be able to shorten that 25 years. the amount of interest that you save will be significant. thousands and thousands of dollars beyond the amount of money that you would be putting into that prepayment. todd: if i could come back to you folks for a second. i think in the media we always throw around phrases and numbers and we really don't understanding what these numbers mean for real america. again  we will throw nancy 	pelosi under the bulls. she a multimillionaire and called this money crumbs. is there something you want to tell america as to how this really isn't just crumbs to you guys? >> well  nancy pelosi my entirely yearly income would probably be crumbs. you get a fluctuation of it $220 cents gallon of gas impacts our lives. every dollar helps. todd: what is your line of work. >> office manager  bookkeeping  accounting. todd: so if you are looking for an office manager  connecticut  my buddy here  ms. dupre. thanks for coming. in dan  always good to see you. good luck and congratulations on the money. >> thank you. todd: fisa memo sending relationships through the fbi. what does it mean for special counsel robert mueller's investigation? we will ask governor mike huckabee when we come back."

we had a news conference  sir  with local officials in south carolina last hour. and they were sailing it's too early to tell  which is understandable about how quickly the speed both trains were traveling at before this collision. and they were also saying it was too early to say why they collided. what's your early sense? you have been through this before. >> yes  indeed  we have been through this. and i suspect that we will have some preliminary information by this afternoon from a number of data sources to be able to pen down the speed of the amtrak train at the point of collision. that's our priority is to -- 	one of our priorities is to recover those recorders and begin a readout of them. ed: my recollection  sir  you are aviator by training but you have had in your position to learn a lot about the train system in this country. give us a big picture because i realize it's early and i don't want to keep pounding about an investigation that's just started. people waking up and see this happen. i ride amtrak all the tile for work. i have to say it's usually very safe. we have to give that context. people are waking up in the united states this morning and seeing that we have now had three crashes just since december. can you give us a big picture of what the ntsb thinks about that and what you are doing to make sure there is not some broader problem? >> well  thank you for trying to keep that somewhat in perspective there. and i think in order for us to be able to comment on the broader picture  we need to really understand what is causing each of these individuals accidents. 	the -- sorry  somebody just handed me a note there. so  the bottom line is that  yeah  let's not try and draw any broad ideas about amtrak right now. let's look at each individual accident and see what's causing them and then the board will be in a better position to comment on that. ed: robert sumwalt from the ntsb. we appreciate your time. we realize it's very early on a sunday morning. you are trying to gets a handle on this situation. please check back with us if you get more information in the next couple of hours. robert sumwalt  thank you. >> thank you  todd. ed: i had would like to turn to mike huckabee former governor of arkansas  fox news contributor. i was on twitter trying to scan through information about this train crash. instead i see governor huckabee get up early sunday morning  get ready for church. i will be on ""fox & friends."" those who watch will sing the hymns better. if you miss it the pastor will point the finger at you 	and scream right at you. sir  can you really back that up? >> absolutely. if you don't watch that segment  all those people who miss it when they get to church this morning the pastor is going to scream at them and call them out. that's why it's embarrassing. that's why they should watch ""fox & friends"" every day. if the president watches  why shouldn't the rest of america. todd: someone screaming this morning leon panetta says he has never seen anything like this in his lifetime like the memo release. let's listen to him and then we will get your reaction. >> when the president distrusts the justice department and the fbi  our primary law enforcement institutions in this country  they're the primary law enforcement agencies under our constitution  and when the president distrusts the fbi and the justice department as he did in this matter  i think it does create a crisis in our system of government. 	todd: governor huckabee  are we in a crisis? >> yeah  we are. the crisis is not because of something that the president has done. the crisis is because of something that the highest officials in the doj and the fbi have done. they have  what apparently appears to be that they have violated the fourth amendment rights of americans by spying on them  using documents that were basically just contrived. they knew they were contrived. they went to a judge. it's really frightening. i have great respect for leon pa net attachment when i'm listening to him. house on fire and firemen came and put water all over my furniture and window. we have got to stop these pfeiffer men from breaking windows and putting water on my furniture. we have to get this in context. ed: context is  governor  what about the fact that some of the most senior government officials that we should be able to trust at the fbi and the department of justice  go to get a fisa 	warrant and fail to tell the judge oh  by the way  the information here in the heat of a presidential campaign  the fall of 2016  we need to surveil someone in the trump campaign and oh  by the way  we are not telling you the information is coming from a dossier paid for by hillary clinton and the dnc. >> that's the problem. if you obtain evidence by doing something dirty to get it  then the evidence is tainted. the legal doctrine is the fruit of the poisonous tree they call it but  it's not unlike a cop who plants drugs on someone in order to get an arrest. if you really out to get somebody  you can probably do it. and even if they don't get convicted and go to prison you have ruined their lives by the time they pay their legal expenses and go through the humiliation of being accused of things. and some people will never believe they're innocent even if later they are proved to be. their lives are destroyed. this is why we must have law enforcement at all levels that is of the highest 	caliber and utmost integrity. look  99.9% of the time we do. when we have a problem with it  you can't just ignore it any more than can you ignore bull conner turning on waters whoswaterhoses and sprayn people in the street. you don't respect that kind of law enforcement. when the law enforcement becomes the law breaker  have you got to stop it  root it out. and turns the lights on and clean it out. that's what has to happen here. rachel: i think that's what devin nunes has been trying to fight tooth and nail for every bit of information. we wouldn't know  governor  the dossier was paid by the hillary campaign and by the dnc had devin nunes not subpoenaed that. and the democrats were fighting for him -- fighting against that subpoena. it's just a huge coverup. >> it is a coverup. i think what maybe disturbs me more than the democrats trying to keep this under wraps because i sort of 	expected that i don't understand how people in the media  people who normally want to expose everything  people who want to make sure that the pentagon papers got published. people who have wanted to make sure that we knew everything about iran contra. people who wanted to make sure that we knew everything about every implication of watergate  and now they suddenly say nothing to see here  let's shut this down. we don't want to see that memo. i had one person respond to me on twitter  a reporter and said oh  yeah  we want to see it i'm not seeing that. i'm seeing many people sitting at their desk pounding their chest saying this is an affront to the constitution. the affront to the constitution is covering it up. ed: all right  the man who will be singing the hymn as little better in church this morning hike huckabee.

	leaders in your party nancy pelosi says it's just crumbs. >> well  let me be quite specific. the president is coming to cincinnati. the people in cincinnati  hamilton county have real concerns and here they are. there's a western hills viaduct going to cost 360 million to repair. 50 000 cars a day. they want some action on that. the federal government needs to help. the brent spence bridge that

help rebuild sewer systems without socking out it -- seeing local rate pairs. ed: i'm not sure the president can do much about sewer bills. >> no  but he can. ed: he can do something about roads and bridges. in all seriousness  the 	president in the state of the union talked about infrastructure he want to get a deal done your colleagues on the democratic side work with him whether it's daca or infrastructure democrats don't want to work with him. here you are in your state saying let's come together what's the disconnect. >> will massive infrastructure needs over $3 trillion nationally. but in ohio specifically  the president is going to be in cincinnati. he can address these issues. sewer systems need to be rebuilt. there's a federal mandate out there that counties and cities can't meet. the federal government has to weigh in. now  parties have to work together. it's absolutely true. are there political differences? you bet there are. but  when we work together  we have to draw the line. no privatization  no tolls. we need to rebuild the infrastructure. the president said he would do in his inaugural speech. i think this is the time. people are expecting him to deliver. ed: you are listening to the voters. are they talking about the 	russia investigation or rather talk about the economy? >> well  you know  there are some people concerned about that. i think most people want to see more jobs. they want to seat infrastructure rebuilt. they want to see their -- they don't want to have to worry when they go across a bridge whether there is going to be any structural problems with the bridge. we have to rebuild america. rebuild ohio. that's what i think people in ohio want. i'm certainly in tune with them on that. ed: congressman  the big question  super bowl

just outside columbia  you can see the trains are absolutely mangled. please ending a presser a short time ago. >> the 70 injuries range obviously in variety. we have anything from small scratches and bumps to more severe broken bones. rachel: brian guinness live following the latest. >> amtrak train 91 was traveling from new york to miami when at 	about 2:35 this morning it collided with a csx freight train. that collision led to the lead engine and a couple of passenger train cars to derail off the tracks. these are the first images we are seeing in daytime. remember  this happened about five hours ago. two dead  unfortunately  in this crash  could authorities. the 70 injured those injuries range from scratches to broken bones as you've been hearing this morning. right now we have the ntsb -- that is the national transportation safety board -- go team en route to this crash right now. these teams are -- leave from washington  d.c. they are the first boots on the ground  so to speak  in this investigation as they now turn to why this happened. those 70 injured have been sent to local area hospitals. remember  there were 139 people on this train  including -- and also eight crew members. those who were not sent to hospitals  there has been a re 	reunification point set up at the local middle school there  pine ridge middle school. now  that reunification center is for passengers to really get out of the elements and maybe get some minor cuts and bruises to be checked out and for that to happen. take a listen right now. remember  this middle school is -- right now this reunification center is being run by the american red cross. >> we are going to step in in any way that we are asked to help because obviously today is quite a tragic day so many people  and the red cross is going to be here to help for as long as we're needed. ed: hazmat teams have responded. there are two leaks. those two fuel leaks have been taken care of  from what we understand. some 5 000 gallons of fuel leaked out because of this crash crash. as we understand  those have been taken care of and pose no risk to the public at this time. we'll keep you updated throughout the morning  guys. rachel: thank you for that. and my heart goes out as all of our hearts go out to all those who were injured and those who lost their lives in this crash. you can see from those images 	those cars are absolutely mangled. it was probably very traumatic to t.em ed: we talked to the head of the ntsb there earlier. they're on top of the situation  they have a go team there. we'll move on to other news and stay on top of that all morning. this weekend has been dominated by the release of the republican memo  it was hashtag release the memo  then it was hashtag memo day. now the president has wanted to turn it into maybe vindication day saying look  enough is enough with the investigating and saying that this shows that from the very beginning of the investigation people in the f.b.i. and the justice department had it out to him. todd: and of course how does the president do that? he tweets. the four-page memo released freeway reports the disturbing fact of how the f.b.i. and fisa has been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath. the f.b.i. failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier. f.b.i. became a tool of anti- anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm 	anyone who wants the f.b.i. to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law. the f.b.i. wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators"" and then cites the wall street journal as the source of that informat.on rachel: president trump coming into office promising to drain the swamp  this looks like swampy stuff. listen  a the fisa approval is a very serious thing. it's probably one of the things that we need maximum trust on. ed: absolutely. rachel: so withholding information is serious filing. i mean  the rules of fisa say don't just tell us what you know you have to tell -- or what we can see. we have to know everything. so if you have a dossier that's paid for by the opposing party in a campaign  the hillary clinton campaign  withheld from judges -- ed: that's a material fact. rachel: it says one of two things  that those specifically tried to mislead the fisa judge or there's not enough oversight and questions  too much trusting 	by the judges  or  god forbid if the judges themselves are corrupt. ed: just try to say ""swampy stuff"" three times stuff. rachel: swampy  swampy. todd: rachel to that point  why that is so important  and i'm going to put a legal hat here. in a normal court  you have a prosecution  you have a defense. here there's nobody fighting for the defense  basically how this works. there is a prosecutor. they provide all the information and then it's the judge who has to sort of put on of ""i'm going to the defense attorney here as well  but at the end of the day i'm the judge."" so that's why that judge needs all the information laid out in front of him to make the ultimate decision. ed: that's why in political context in this situation the lead in the defense is not an attorney  it's the president himself. he goes on twitter  as you say  he pushes back with reporters on friday saying what's in the memo is disgraceful  people should be ashamed of themselves. and jason chaffetz says  look  this is not just about donald trump versus the investigators. this is about real problems and corruption at the f.b.i. and the doj  not with agents out in the 	field  not with the brave men and women who keep us safe in terror cases  but with the leadership that grew corrupt and jason chaffetz who was in the middle of trying to fix this when he was in congress says it's the president who's going to clean it up. >> donald trump didn't create this mess  but he is here to help clean it up. anybody who reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system. and  you know  all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats that this was an attack on law enforcement  this was going to dismantle our security apparatus this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true  none of it. todd: as you might imagine  the mainstream media out with a lot of headlines this morning and it basically pit the president and republicans on one side versus law enforcement. let's take a lookr some of these these. this is mitt romney. ""how conservatives learn to hate the 	f.b.i."" from huffington post  the law and order party has unleashed an extraordinary attack on law enforcement. from washington post: ""once the party of law and order  republicans are now challenging it."" and this is from that article  republican leaders open defiance last week of the f.b.i. over the release of a hotly disputed memo how the f.b.i. which has long positioned itself as the party of law and order has become an adversary of federal law enforcement as the party continues its quest to protect president trump from the russia investigation. i want to toss it over to you folks  rachel and ed  because you know d.c. very well  you know these institutions. i'm going to just comment quickly from my experience at the diners  okay? i go around and i talk to average americans in average americans and we talk to average men and women there. to a man and to a woman they say they love this administration because for the first time in eight years the shackles are off of them  they can do their jobs 	and not worry  they are so excited by this administration  and they are law enforcement  and they are military. again  that's out there. what's going on in d.c.? rachel: if anybody is against law enforcement  it's the left. and you're absolutely right. i live in small-town america. law enforcement loves donald trump. the rank-and-file at the f.b.i. i'm sure is glad to see the leadership that's corrupt cleaned up. if anything  this is a self- self-inflicted wound by the leadership at the f.b.i. who allowed itself to be corrupted with comey and everybody else at the top using their powers to un undo an election and once donald trump was elected  trying to damage him. and we've been spending a year talking about russia. i look at what's in that memo. we have a drunken conversation with a low-level staffer and a dirty dossier. this is embarrassing for the new york times  for everybody else who for one year has tried to change the conversation to russia. and you're right  todd  the american people aren't buying it it. no one's talking about russia and middle america. ed: it's interest because the 	president and  you know  taken from the horse's mouth  what he has actually said about law enforcement  we put it together. watch. >> with me as your president  america's police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the white house  more loyal than anyone else can be  i tell you . [applause] i am the big  big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement  okay? from day one. we have your back  believe me  we have your backs 100%. we celebrate our police  our military  and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering suppor. ed: and in fact it was the president who took all kinds of heat for standing up before anyone else did and said  ""you know what? the folks in the nfl should be standing for the anthem."" he says it's because he thinks 	they should be standing for men and women in uniform  for law enforcement. there are others who are saying ""no  it's about  you know  the first amendment and having peaceful protests."" president said you can have protests  there's peaceful protests  but just respect the flag. so we've got pete hegseth  outreached who's not on the couch today  he's live in minneapolis. pete  it's interesting the man who first stood up and said  "" ""enough is enough  nfl  stand up and honor the flag  honor our men and women in uniform"" is now on defense with people claiming he's against law enforcement. >> it's such a great point. the partisan opposition to this president -- when i say partisan i don't just mean the democrats  i mean the so-called mainstream media is so disingenuous. can you imagine if this was a democratic president targeted bay republican president and d.o.j. they would be going wall-to-wall demanding scalps. instead they're apologizing for democrats and pointing the finger  as you said  at the one guy who has reinstilled confidence in law enforcement who are under siege from accusations  the black lives 	matter movement. so this is political disingenuous. nancy pelosi knows it. and i know this president will continue to fight back 'cause he's had the backs of law enforcement. and to call out the top doesn't mean you're calling out the rank-and-file. it means you're cleaning out the partisan agenda and backing the guys on the ground. rachel: pete  you're so right. if this had been reversed  if george bush had spied on barack obama as a presidential candidate and continued on as a sitting president  not only would they be demanding more and more information and transparency  which they don't want now  which it's fascinating to see the media not want more information  believe me  this would be called racism. this was the attack on the first you know  black president. but it's a white man  it's donald trump  who's politically incorrect  and the media is actually working with the democrats to cover this up. >> well  that's the collusion right there. and they're working with the democrats to try to get enough votes in the house of representatives in 2018 so they can hold the hearings they want 	to hear and release the memos they want to release. in reality  god bless what devin nunes has done in pushing it out out. the discussion will continue. we'll see what phase 2 looks like. but it is very disingenuous and i think as you pointed out  todd middle america will see it. todd: get warm  pete. we'll talk football later. the fisa memo bringing to light some shocking new revelations. our next guest was an f.b.i. agent for 24 years. he says it showed how comey disgraced the honorable bureau. he'll explain when we come back. oh! there's one. manatees in novelty ts? surprising. what's ""come at me bro?"" it's something you say to a friend. what's not surprising? how much money matt saved by switching to geico. fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 	>> republicans on the house intel panel released that controversial fisa memo on friday bringing to light what they say are some pretty 	shocking revelations. todd: joining us now to react is chris schweiker who served 24 years as an f.b.i. special agent agent. sir  with all due respect  to our other guests today this interview is arguably the most important because of your background as an f.b.i. agent. so i'll ask you right off the bat  you've heard other individuals saying the f.b.i. is going to go after the president  the f.b.i. hates the president  this was bad  this is now f.b.i. versus president. how do you react to that? >> i'd say  look  chris ray and you have a the new deputy direct david baudich are going to do no such thing. what we're talking about here say breakdown in the senior leadership of the f.b.i. under jim comey and andy mccabe as deputy director. i would hate for the public to think that the f.b.i. as an institution is flawed or biased. what this is is a very small inner circle of senior leadership under jim comey at a very critical time period  and i 	just don't want this to reflect on the 35 000 very -- you know  the excellent men and women of the f.b.i. who are doing a great job every day. ed: so chris  let's get specific specific. and we've heard the partisan attacks on all sides  people who don't like the president  people who like the president and people who like james comey and don't like james comey. so i think as todd said  it's very important to get your perspective as somebody who was inside the f.b.i. so james comey holds himself out there even today on twitter and instagram as this paragon of virtue  above the fray. you were there for 24 years. how do you think he's paved over the last couple of years  you know  his public performance as f.b.i. director both in the clinton probe and then how he handled president trump? >> well  i had the perspective of serving directly under director murral. i bet i sat in on 500-plus meetings with him and director freeh  and these were two great leaders. they stayed in the background. i never saw a hint of bias. unfortunately  under jim comey  that hubris that you just mentioned caused him to make up 	his own rules -- leaks  permissive leak environment  pre predetermining investigations  a noninvestigation of the clinton email investigation  thumb on the scale on the russian investigation in the beginning here with the fisa applications  and just generally making up their own rules and letting their own political opinions infect their investigation. that is something you learn at the fbi academy. you can't let your personal bias bias. you've got to leave those at home. if not you need to be in another line of business. >> defenders of james comey have said  oh  it's not a big deal that he and andrew mccabe and others were drafting this exoneration statement for hillary clinton months before they even interviewed her. i'm an outsider  we're outsiders we don't know how the f.b.i. does its job. is that the proper way? i mean  people on the outside hear that and say  three months before she was exonerated  they were already drafting the statement. doesn't that sound like it was 	cooked? >> yes  it does. it sounds like the thumb is on the scale. those of us that have done criminal investigations and counterintelligence investigations know that the clinton email investigation was not a real investigation. they never even once used a grand jury that i know of. we're hearing  those of us that are in the retired agent community  we're hearing that deputy director mccabe was expressing his opinions in closed-door meetings all the time about trump  so we're talking about a predetermined investigation. and that is just not how the f.b.i. as a whole operates. todd: that's scary for democrac. ed: we appreciate it  chris schweiker. meanwhile  the president wants to make a deal on immigration. that's what he says  but democrats not bundle. so what does the hispanic community think of the president president's plan? todd: plus now that the fisa memo is out what will happen to deputy attorney general rod rosenstein? we will ask corey lewandowski coming up. 	but what a powerful life lesson. and don't worry i have everything handled. i already spoke to our allstate agent  and i know that we have accident forgiveness. which is so smart on your guy's part. like fact that they'll just... forgive you... four weeks without the car. okay  yup. good night. with accident forgiveness your rates won't go up just because of an accident. switching to allstate is worth it. 	okay  iunderwear that's'd say this  bactually pretty.er leak surprised?

we're asking daniel garza president of an initiative which works to advance the hispanic community. full disclosure  i used to work there  i was your national spokesperson for a while. >> terrific. rachel: daniel  you're the president of libre. why shouldn't -- first of all  is libre backing the plan? let's start with that. >> we commend the president. we praise what he announced. 	if he feel that some very -- it's a very strong and bold proposal. there are aspects to it that i think merit further consideration like of course the restrictions or the arbitrary cuts to family migration  but overall this is a reason for the democrats to come to the table and finally get a long-term permanent solution. rachel: so libre is will be to come to the negotiating table on this. why aren't other groups  i like at la raza  lulac  why aren't they going to the frustrating table? >> that's been the frustrating part for the latino community  for the democrats honestly it's been a lot of lip service  they have not delivered on any kind of legislation. look  in 2007 george bush was ready to sign a law. frist  who led the senate -- ed: senate leader. >> right  the senate leader of the republican majority passed legislation  and it actually stalled at the desk of nancy pelosi and rahm emanuel. and then barack obama actually had the white house  had the senate  had the house  but did 	not see it as a priority. ed: 2008 barack obama said  ""my first year in office i will get comprehensive."" he made that promise directly to the latino community. todd: is the republican is named joe smith and not donald trump  does this get passed by the democrats? >> i believe so. again  we believe that the arbitrary cuts to family migration is probably the discussion we should be having  more long term  more be packaged for permanent reform that has to do with legal migration. but again this is a reason to come to the table. this is an opportunity right now to finally do something. the president blew everybody away by actually proposing that he would give citizenship to 2018 million daca -- rachel: three times what obama offered  right? >> almost three times that  exactly right. so  look  everything you heard about donald trump  you'd think he would actually maybe reduced that number down  but he actually almost tripled it. 	rachel: he made a deal they really shouldn't be able to refuse. >> no  he did show heart. ed: and talking about results  the president everyone assumed he's going to have the worst relationship with mexico and yet their foreign relations secretary just put out this statement. i think in many ways the relationship today is more fluid it's closer than it was with previous administrations. so is that a negotiating strategy by mexico saying  you know  chuck schumer  put the wall on the table a couple weeks ago  this might be more of a reality than we thought  we've got to kind of reach out to donald trump  or have things actually gotten better despite what the mainstream media -- >> according to the media you would think this is counter counterintuitive  but the negotiations with nafta actually have proven very productive. they are now in their seventh round. at the end of february they're going to be in mexico city  and there are discussions now obviously on food safety  on telecommunications  on digital issues. these are all things that create dialogue  that engender i think a relationship that has been very positive with mexico. and they are seeing that there's a lot more to donald trump than 	the media led them to believe. and look  this is important. nafta has to be negotiated because  you know  we are 450 million people in this market. we are 28% of the world's gdp. this is important stuff. the president is paying attention to -- ed: wait. the media said everything is going to fall apart if you re renegotiated nafta. they were saying it's a disaster disaster. you're saying it's reopened dialogue? >> it's increased exports by the agricultural industry by 350%. it is phenomenal. created 40 million jobs  25 million of which are here in the -- ed: daniel garcia  we're glad that we stole rachel away from you. thanks for coming in. >> it's a pleasure. rachel: president trump blasting the media  saying they refused to cover his rising poll numbers numbers. is he right?

why not just tell the truth? >> look. i think anybody who's questioned by the f.b.i. should tell the truth. and  you know  if general flynn 	didn't tell the truth  which is what happened  and now he's pled to a felony  you know  he needs to be accountable for that. but let's go back and look at hillary clinton. you know  cheryl mills  huma abedin  they have never been under oath  in accountability for that. what we do know unequivocally is this: only one campaign in the last election cycle paid for a dossier with a former spy to go to russia  and then they took that information and used it to spy on american citizens in u.s. soil. this is one of the grossest abuses of the fourth amendment we've seen. rachel: a lot of people are saying the answer to all of this is a radical transparency. are you going to recommend to the president that he release even more documents  maybe some of the transcripts from those interviews to show whether or not there was bias or at least that hillary and huma and all those figures were treated differently? how much transparency should we get? >> look. 	we need to have as much transparency in this case as possible pin that some of the media has asked for jim comey's contemporaneous needs to be released. jim comey takes contemporaneous notes  he then releases them to his law professor to make sure they end up in the media and that's okay  and there's been no accountability for jim comey. you can't have it both ways  lying jim. either you release on the information to the public  you don't give select information to your law professor so it gets in the media. that's where the american people are have we concept elk. james comey has lied to congress and needs to be held accountabl. todd: with regard to accountability  is it time for rod rosenstein to go? >> well  that's a question that the president and attorney general sessions have to decide. i know that rod rosenstein  according to this memorandum  his name is on at least signing off on the application for the fisa warrant  based on on the false dossier. 	that should give people in the justice department grave concern that the credibility of the information that they had and presented to the fisa court was not accurate. and rod needs to answer for those questi.ns ed: how do we do that? do we expect hearings before the house intelligence committee? because the bottom line here is that you just called james comey ""lying jim."" that was an appointee of president obama but as you know  rod rosenstein was nominated by president trump. how frustrating is it to you as a trump insider that somebody nominated by this president helped sign off on the fisa warrant? >> well  it's very concerning. it's not just because he's appointed by trump. it's concerning that he signed off on an application to spy on a u.s. citizen on domestic soil on a false dossier and a false premise. and if that's the type -- look. the f.b.i. is one of the greatest law enforcement agencies that we've ever had  and i respect the people that work in the department of justice. but if this is the type research they're do and presenting to a 	federal judge to ask for the opportunity to spy on a u.s. citizen  we should have some real grave concerns  because it's not about one person  about a larger narrative. are they spying on me and you with a false dossier? is clinton funding any other information that they're using to spy on american citizens? if so  that's a real problem and those people need to be held accountable for it. rachel: thank you  corey  you're right  we need to restore trust in our institutions. we got to leave it there. thank you for joining us this morning. turning now to your headlines 3. terrifying moments caught on dash cam as a man lunges off his car  attacking a police officer with a knife. >> stop! get down now! stay right there! stop or i'll shoot you! rachel: the suspect  brett bush  leading the georgia officer on a high speed chase after attempting to pull him over for speeding. the 28 year old crashing into a georgia driveway before being shot and killed by the unidentified officer. the cop  who was also a marine veteran  is not injured. 	at least nine states now considering new laws requiring residents to buy health insurance. the proposal coming less than two months after republicans voted to repeal the individual mandate in obama-backed affordable care act. according to that act  people should not be forced to pay for coverage. some of those states include maryland  california  and new jersey  according to the wall street journal. todd: and eight players elected to the pro football hall of fame modern era stars  randy moss  terrell owens  ray lewis  bob you are lacquer  robert brazil  and jerry cramer of vikings fame up there in minnesota this weekend. they'll be enshrined in canton  ohio  this summer. in the meantime  there's a little game  patriots quarterback tom brady is involved in that game  named the nfl's most valuable player. can you believe it's only his 	third award?

stuart varney. this seems like manna from heaven for republicans who are worried  frankly  because of the historical trends and the fact that the party in power usually loses seats in the midterms  but when you have every single democrat in the house and senate vote against a tax cut that seems to be helping the economy  whoa. >> it's extraordinary  isn't it? do you remember that expression ""it's the economy  stupid?"" remember that? that was back in the 1990s. >> pardon me  what did you call me? >> that was the mantra for winning elections back then. well  look at the economy now as we head towards the midterms. wages are rising at the fastest pace in many  many years. bonuses  316 companies are giving these bonuses  and that's just big companies. three million people are getting them. best buy just joined the list  giving a thousand bucks to a hundred thousand full time employees. your pension plan's looking a whole lot of better. your paychecks went up this month. 	there are 127 million paychecks  full-time jobs in america. roughly 110 million got an increase in their paycheck. so if you're looking at the economy  and you're looking at the election  you got to say that things are going in the republicans' favor. and  by the way  the president's approval rating just hit almost 42%. now  that's low  but it's much better than it's ever been over it is past year. rachel: certainly those comments from nancy pelosi calling -- where i live  stewart  when you have an extra thousand dollars at the end of the year they call it christmas. >> yes. can i just break in for one second to get this in. rachel: yes. >> three times nancy pelosi has said 86 million middle class american families will pay more with this tax bill. that is utter nonsense. that's malicious spin at the very best. debbie wasserman schultz  she said precisely  ""i'm not sure that a thousand dollars goes very few for anyone."" how out of touch can you get? 	if the democrats go into the midterms with that as their leadership spouting utter economic nonsense  i think the republicans got a decent cha.ce ed: quickly  stuart  in the time we have remaining  the situation on friday  where the market absolutely tanked on good news. explain why that had happened. rob:. >> good news  like i just said  the economy is really moving forward. that means interest rates goes up. when interest rates go up  you can get a nice return on a bond. so some people who have done very well in the stock market  might want to sell a little bit of their stock  sell some of it  put into a bond which is very secure  treasury bond  nearly 3% you sleep well at night  you get your 3%  you get a tax break on the interest on you might sell a little stock. rachel: free advice from stuart varney. ed: coming

really good team  the new orleans saints. you're not really thinking much. you're reacting and playing. when i let the ball go i knew he had a chance to catch it. when he jumped up and i see  you know  his white gloves going up for the catch  you knew he had chamber of commerce to catch it. when he came down i thought he was going to get out of bounds and i'm glad he didn't. >> you and me both. you say there's unfinished business. obvious the nfc championship didn't go the way we wanted. do you feel like we'll see case keenum in purple next year? >> i don't know. i can't tell the future. you know  i love this team  i love this city. i love playing in this stadium. you know  and  yeah  there's the 	whole team feels like there's some unfished business  some meat left on the bone. like i said  i would love to play with these guys  but  you know  the nature of the business side of this game is that you have to make tough decisions. >> we only have 15 seconds but faith plays a big role in who you are. tell us about that? >> yeah  it's a huge part for me and my wife. god has been instrumental in everywhere we've been  he's had an incredible plan for me and my wife and  you know  i couldn't be more happy with where we wound up here  just continue to trust in him. >> met your wife at photocopy of christian athletes. my dad used to lead a huddle of that as well. it's a great way

investigators to arrive at any major accident such as this. this all started at 2:35 this morning was when both trains collided. amtrak train 91 from new york to miami collided with a csx freight train. what you're looking at right now are photos from the red cross at pine ridge middle school which is where many survivors and victims were taken to at a shelter remember it's 38 degrees outside and raining and these folks went through a very traumatic experience being taken care of at the local shelter. this is video from the scene this morning. governor henry mcmaster is set to speak to the

that collided. what we immediately went into was a search mode  search and rescue mode. we are able to begin to extract and assist passengers off of that train. at this time  all passengers are off of the train. that is very important to put out there. reporter: that is very important to point out you have eight crew members that were on that train  139 passengers  everyone has been taken off the train. important because that means that  you know  there aren't people that are mangled or have serious issues that are still on scene so everyone is being treated in hospitals  again these injuries range from scratches to severe broken bones no reports of anybody necessarily in critical condition  so back to you guys. 	ed: brian thanks for staying on top of the story. in the meantime the story that's been dominating the weekend of course is that republican memo that started out as hashtag release the memo and then hashtag help o day and now it's hashtag vindication if you listen to the president. todd: one way the president communicates with all of us is the tweet. the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa influenced the 2016 election and its aftermath. the fbi failed to inform the fisa court the clinton campaign had funded the dossier about fbi became a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and not to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a non-partisan enforcer of the law the fbi wasn't straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators and cites the wall street journal. todd: what's interesting is this is just phase i. devon nunes has an interview on 	friday on special report and everyone thought this is it. this is part one  state department is next. you heard jason chaffetz earlier on the show saying they are digging into the intelligence community saying this was going to damage national security and then the memo comes out there does not appear to be any damage to national security so devon nunes is going to keep pushing and he's the person who we wouldn't know anything about fusion gps and the hillary clinton campaign paying for the dossier without him demanding those bank reports. rachel: he's had to fight tooth and nail against members of congress who should care about transparency and ethics and the fbi and doj. after all they have oversight over those agencies. really pushing back against that   we wouldn't know at all that the dossier was paid for by the dnc. ed: more coming from nunes but also more from the department of justice inspector general putting out this report and a little earlier jason chaffetz laid it all out. >> donald trump didn't create this mess but he is here to help 	clean it up. anybody who reads that memo will understand that what the lawmakers are highlighting here is potential abuses in our system and  you know all the flailing that i heard from adam schiff and all these democrats that this was an attack on law enforcement  this is going to dismantle our security apparatus   this is going to reveal sources and methods  none of that is true. none of it. todd: bottom line is that report from the inspector general some said it might be months away i've been hearing in washington weeks away so more is coming. ed: if you woke up this morning to decide you're reading papers  a completely different view of the world. the view being put out there is donald trump is going to attack our fbi and our law enforcement. let's take a look at headlines from the new york times or as pete likes to say the failing new york times. trump's unparalleled war on a pillar of society law enforcement. this one comes from politico trump escalates his war with u.s. law enforcement after memo 	release. washington post once the party of law and order republicans are now challenging it and so you could hear the three of us talk about this and give our opinions on it. i've told you what mine is i go to these diners and talk to people including law enforcement and they love this president but ed and i have the good fortune to sit down with an fbi agent and we asked him directly  what do you think. ed: he had a surprise. he went after james comey and said the leadership is a problem but had a little surprise about andrew mccabe. >> those of us in the retired agent community we're hearing that director deputy director money cake was expressing his conditions in closed door meetings all the time about trump so we're talking about a pre-determined investigation and that is just not how the fbi as a whole operates. the problem is agents on the street don't operate that way. todd: interesting andrew mccabe ousted this past week as deputy director. his wife in 2015 was running for the state senate in virginia with money from the buddy of the 	clintons that has been aired. he waited until the very last minute to recuse himself in the hillary clinton investigation was overseeing it even though his wife had gotten money. okay fast forward the text messages  strzok and page. the insurance policy was about if donald trump gets elected there's a meeting in andy's office we believe that to be andrew mccabe and now we're hearing from a former retired fbi agent that in fact mccabe he's hearing was out in private meetings giving his opinion saying he didn't like donald trump what in the world was going on? rachel: it's interesting you said the democrats said the republican party used to be the party of law and order and the democrat used to be the party of jfk. i think what we're seeing is this is officially the party of bernie sanders  socialists don't care about individual rights all the individual rights that have been violated through the unmask ing and the spying on the lack of transparency in the upper departments  this is a party a socialistic party who cares about the state  the collective. not individual rights and that's 	why if you're wondering why democrats and the media which is one in the same are not concerned about all this that's your answer in my opinion. ed: we've got a lot of other headlines this morning. rachel: turning to your headlines now. terrifying moments caught on camera  when a police officer is run over by a carjacking suspect while making an arrest. police storming the vehicle before the driver backs over the two. the suspect flees running them over again. a plain-clothes officer had a gun drawn on the suspects but did not fire. policy prohibits san francisco police from shooting at cars their union says it puts officer s lives in danger. the suspects were arrested and the officer is expected to be okay. christian broadcasting network founder pat robertson recovering after suffering from a stroke. a family member rushing the 87 year old to a hospital in virginia after recognizing symptoms. robertson hosts the flagship show the 700 club  and interview ed president trump during his campaign and after 	the election. he is expected to make a full recovery. president trump and the first lady are hosting a super bowl party. wow i wish i was invited. [laughter] at mar-a-lago  the first family will hold the festivities before traveling back to washington. the president has a friendly relationship with the new england patriots especially the owner robert craft and quarterback tom brady. todd: speaking of the big game our own pete hegseth is live in his home state of minnesota for super bowl lii. pete you still look cold. it hasn't warmed up that much. pete: holy cow it's only getting colder it's negative 22 is what it feels like right now so i can barely feel my face  but we'll go with it. we're outside the stadium where it will be rocking tonight when the philadelphia eagles take on new england patriots but there's no way to sugar coat that this has been a difficult year for the nfl. the kneeling controversy  the anthem controversy  and we've seen the ratings drop significantly. there's actually a wall street journal nbc news poll that came out just yesterday that said 	that viewership is down this year substantially from two  three  four years ago so i went to the mall of america which is just a hop  skip and a jump from here yesterday to talk to fans of the nfl and say did the kneeling controversy affect you  are you watching more  are you watching less? this is what the fans had to say about the nfl this year. >> i watched just as much as i did before. pete: so none of the controversy around the nfl anthem protest and things like that affected you? >> no not at all. actually i respect their decision. we wish they would stand up. we love our country. we want them to do it. stand up. they make millions of dollars in this country. they couldn't go anywhere else and do it so stand up and honor our flag. >> i was in the service for 23 years  yeah it affects me personally  sometimes i had to shut the game off. i can't even watch it any more. pete: you know guys  bottom line   fans want politics out of sports. a lot of people said i still 	watch but i watch reluctantly but the ratings reflect there's plenty of people that have turned off the dial. no doubt the nfl this off season will have to address what they do with patriotism and the anthem because viewership is down substantially. rachel: well maybe that's what they're doing with all of the veterans they are having on the show you've been interviewing? pete: well that's true. they're donating the veterans project having veterans on the field. some people feel like that's window dressing at the end of a tough season. what they really do next year will affect how a lot of people view the league. ed: he's got kellyanne conway coming in live from the super bowl we'll go back to pete. pete: coming in cold  soon. ed: thanks so much pete we'll see you soon. rachel: thanks pete stay warm. todd: how ins devon nunes says there are more memos coming we've been talking about that all morning long and the next one could target the state department so what do we know about this memo? sarah carter has been on top of the story from the very beginning she's been digging into this specifically and joins us live  next. 	>> ♪ ♪ when you combine ancestry's dna test with its historical records... ...you could learn you're from ireland... ...donegal  ireland... ...and your ancestor was a fisherman. with blue eyes. just like you. begin your journey at ancestry.com he gets the best deal on the perfect hotel by using. tripadvisor! that's because tripadvisor lets you start your trip on the right foot... by comparing prices from over 200 booking sites to find the right hotel for you at the lowest price. 	saving you up to 30%! you'll be bathing in savings! tripadvisor. check the latest reviews and lowest prices. a little to the left. 1  2  3  push! easy! easy! easy!

>> i think you're right on the mark there  ed. look  they came out not just ker ry  but we saw  you know  care ic holder  we saw many other members of the obama administration cop out and say this is going to destroy national security we don't want this out  director comey was another one  former fbi director comey and what we discovered was there was nothing in there and i've spoken to a number of u.s. intelligence sources about this. there was nothing in that memo at all that would have damaged national security of the united states  or the processes by which they gather the fisa warrants  right? 	or the application so now we have to ask ourselves why and i believe your right. this is due to the second memo that the intelligence committee is putting together and we're sit waiting for the inspector general's report coming out that's directed at andrew mccabe   deputy  you know now former deputy director andrew mccabe and others and i think they're terrified because this is what we know. there was a second dossier put together by a person named cody shear. a very controversial activist a former reporter who worked with the clintons in the past and the fbi was also using the second dossier as part of what they were doing to back up the other dossier that christopher steele unverified dossier. another thing that's important is we believe and i've been talking to sources that christopher steele was also sending information to the state department in bits and snip-ins but i think the most important thing here and one of the things they're looking at very closely 	are the leaks. there were a number of leaks of unverified information by possibly senior members of the obama administration. ed: i want to bring rachel in as well but you said something about a second dossier and i've heard rumblings of that but i'm not sure if viewers have heard too much about it so briefly we can get rachel in here as well is this a second anti-trump dossier what do we know? >> okay this is what we know here. there is a second anti-trump dossier that i have been able to confirm. that was written by cody shear. now he is not an expert and has no background in intelligence. he is a former reporter and political hack ski vest and also had a close relationship with cindy blumenthal  and remember i wrote a piece about it how cindy blumenthal would be connected to the dossier in one fashion or another and those are the bits of information as we unravel this great mystery of the dossier those are the little 	bits of information that we have out there. now the house intelligence committee and others who are investigating this like senator grassley we don't want to takeaway from senator grassley because senator grassley's letter and his exposure of christopher steele and asking for everybody's communications  if you look at senator grassley 's letter he's asked the doj for all the communication of cody shear  of cindy blumenthal  of christopher steele. those are little pieces of this puzzle that we're putting together and as we've seen  they're kicking and screaming. they don't want this information out into the public and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they were involved in using this dossier to leak information. rachel: so sarah  it sounds like what you're saying is that it's maybe we're going to go talk about not the russians but all of the collusion happening in these investigations. ed: yeah. rachel: i don't have another question you answered all of them so thank you. >> thanks. ed: all right the marines are doing something they haven't done in 30 years running a super 	bowl ad  their goal get younger fans. the head of recruiting joins us live to talk about that  next. so a few years ago  me and my wife were actually saving for a house. but one day we were sitting there and we decided that  you know what?

>> we're trying to have a conversation with young people that are seeking challenges in life and what you're seeing is a 	culmination of an ad campaign that appeals to men and women across this country that have fought through battles throughout their high school careers and they seek to further that by joining the service and serving their country. todd: looking at the calendar  i understand that february through may is a really tough time to recruit. why is that? >> well typically when a young person becomes a senior in high school  they're eligible to en list in one of the services and so most of those contracts get written in the summer months and into the first few months of the school year  the new school year   so by the time february rolls around  you've probably written most of those kids signed them up for service and now what we're doing is mostly writing kids that have graduated high school  are seeking something else in their life  and it's a little bit tougher in those months. todd: and tell us  i mean everyone gets around the table gets around the tv set  gets 	around their iphone now to watch the big game. what message do you want to send to americans  when we still have so many troops in harms way all around the world. >> look  young people today are faced with a multitude of pressures. the battle that they fight just getting through high school  staying out of trouble  getting good grades they might be working a job to help support their family. by the time they're finished they may want to continue to seek those challenges and so 38 000 young people signed up last year to join the marines and for that very purpose. rachel: well you've chosen  you're saving the marine corps a lot of money by doing this online and not an actual television ad. you called these young people cord cutters what do you mean by that? >> well  increasingly young people are getting their news and information and entertainment from means other than television  broadcast television so they're getting it on handheld devices and tablets 	and watching it when they want to watch it and so we thought it was smart and it was effective cost effective to reach out during the super bowl this year to about 20 million people that mostly younger people under 30 that will take in our ad and message. we'll have a conversation with them tonight. todd: major general paul kennedy we appreciate your service we thank you for that all of the men and women serving with you and we hope that you bring in a few good men and women art super bowl. >> thank you  sir. rachel: still ahead  president trump heading to ohio tomorrow after a super bowl party in florida tonight  so watt can we expect from this trip?

>> i find it to be hyperbolic and very hypocritical because they've been charging forward for over one year now  promising 	collusion  promising a change in the election results and nullification of a democrat if elected president. that's just not happening and i know they're still trying to get over an election result they neither expected nor wanted but that's too bad and this whole idea that we're only supposed to investigate one piece and not the other is really wrong and i hear these people saying this is unprecedented and you really are hurting the relationship with the doj and the fbi. the president made very clear and i'll say it again yet again  he respects the rankin file and the great hard work these men and women do every day as part of the fbi and those in the doj as well  but that doesn't mean that a couple of the bad apples out there who were just starting to see had nefarious intentions and were desperate to try to at least affect the outcome or after president trump was elected to mess with him during transition. pete: well we're hearing more will come out and it could come out additional memos and when they do we'll ask you about that 	as well. >> i support that as well in other words if the schiff memo comes forward then go ahead. we're for transparency but look you can't argue this not under oath through the cable tv wars and that's what's happening. people are going on saying things that are simply not true hoping they will come true. pete: well this president spark a national debate when he talked about kneelers? we're here at the nfl and there's no way to scoot around it. it was a tough year at the nfl for those who leave you stand for the national anthem a big national debate. what's your takeaway you'll cheer for your team in the super bowl today but the nfl learned a lot of lessons this year what's your takeaway from the stance the president took about standing for the anthem? >> the president is unlike any other american citizen. he can stand up for the flag and express that he's got a big mega phone of course in my house and many households across the country you say you take a knee for the lord and stand for the flag. i think that we don't have any kneelers today we'll see what happens. i thought my philadelphia eagles 	handled well from the very beginning they had huge field- wide flag and wonderful man singing the national anthem including the nfc championship african american veteran and i think that was very uplifting to those who love the flag and believe in it  but also i think when you look at the grammies  the emmys all of the ratings are down because people look at sports  you look at entertainment and these award shows as an escape. they don't try and run for politics and don't want to hear negative necessarily all day long. i know it's easy to take a cheap shot but to what end? it's not  it doesn't really fit with these award shows and the themes they're supposed to have so i think here people are all about the great tradition of the super bowl and it ends up being a worldwide event . lots of great fans out there  eagles fans are excited ran into patriots fans but it should be a 	great game and one of the greatest american traditions and enjoy themselves eat a little bit too much and cheer the big green on to victory. pete: we heard that just keep the politics out of it is what you heard time and time again. well guys i'll toss it back to you but let me say  kellyanne conway can play in the cold. rachel: she looks less cold than you. >> i'm definitely the summer parent at home but i thought i'd do this on a special day. pete: champion thank you. tossing it back to new york. rachel: great interview. ed: good stuff. rachel: turning to your headlines now. terrifying moments caught on a dashcam as a man lunges off his car attacking a police officer with a knife. >> stop  get out  now! stay right there. stop or i'll shoot you. rachel: the suspect brett bush leading the georgia officer on a high speed chase after attempting pull him over for speeding. the 28 year old crashing into a georgia driveway before being 	shot and killed. the cop whose also a marine veteran is not injured. and an elementary school canceling its father-daughter dance due to new gender rules. parents and students are furious with the staten island new york school fighting a state mandate to eliminate gender-based activities. if school officials are telling the new york post ""father- daughter dances inherent ly leave people out  not just because of transgender status  just life in general. these can be really uncomfortable events."" the school's pta is planning to reschedule the dance for kids and caregivers of any gender for march 2. thousands of dollars worth of jewelry stolen from the pregnant fiancee of actor john stamos on the eve of their wedding. actress indicate rib mccue were not in their upscale beverly hotel room. the pieces were reportedly on 	loan. no surveillanceses have been identified. the wedding went on as planned and the hollywood couple tying the knot. ed: have mercy. rachel: beautiful company and today is world cancer day  raising awareness of the global fight against this disease and it also honors survivors and advances in treatments being made every single day. nearly 9 million people die from cancer worldwide every year. the theme of today is ""we can  i can."" the campaign encourages everyone to do their part to help end the disease. this is a look at all of the cancer-fighting events happening around the world right now  including fundraisers and screenings and those are your headlines guys. ed: great cause. all right  meanwhile the stock market preparing for another big week. the dow plunged 600 points on friday  what could we expect at the opening bell  no one breaks it down better maria bartiromo here next. todd: plus we're just hours away from kickoff csx freight and so we've got last-minute menu ideas for your super bowl party all that coming up when fox and 	friends on a sunday returns. sometimes a cough gets in the way of a good night's sleep. that's when he needs vicks vaporub. proven cough medicine. with 8 hours of vapors. so he can sleep. vicks vaporub. goodnight coughs. the center of the how canneighborhood?r house first  mix liquid gold velveeta with the one-two kick of ro*tel's diced tomatoes and spicy green chilies. then  find space for extra parking. lots and lots of parking. 	ed: tomorrow like just about every weekday morning the stock market reopening for the first time following friday's sharp sell off the dow tumbling 665 points the worst drop in more than a year of course the big picture is its been going up up up. rich what can we expect for the markets this week here to break it all down sunday morning futures host maria bartiromo. welcome. maria: hi guys great to see you. maria: good to see you. rachel: so the question is we saw this sell off in the market but you say it's for all of the good reasons. maria: it is  i mean look there's still broad support for this market because the impact of the tax plan hasn't really been felt entirely yet. right now it's just anticipation we also haven't seen the full impact of the regulatory rollback so there's a real support for this market because the underlying fundamentals are 	very strong. friday we got a jobs number out 200 000 jobs created in the month of january and also the atlanta federal reserve coming out with a new prediction on economic growth  they've got a gaap number for the first quarter which we're in of 5.4%. ed: are you actually trying to make the case that crumbs will equal real bread for people? maria: my god 100% this tax plan is going far and deep there's a really big impact felt from on individuals as well as corporations and that will continue to help economic growth so i think that markets don't go up in a straight line forever. we've had an incredible performance $8 trillion in market value since the election. of course you are going to see markets go up and down and now that we're talking about a different scenario  we have a new conversation happening right now. it's about higher wages and inflation these are the things that happen with a stronger economy. that wage number on friday was very strong up 2.9% year-over-year we're finally see ing individual wages go up and that's why markets have been 	nervous. todd: but i think it could be confusing to the average american who doesn't necessarily fully understand economics why we could have an amazing jobs growth number and then we see a market tank basically almost 700 points. explain how it all comes back to interest rates. maria: yeah because when you're investing you have to make a decision do i want to take on a little more risk and look for a higher return and go into the stock market or do i want to stay with the safety of treasur ies where you know you've got the full back of the country of the treasury and look for a higher interest rate. once interest rates start going higher then you have a debate. well do i want to stay safe and go into the bond market and see interest rates go higher or do i want to stay in stocks and dole with a little more risk? ed: and bond buyers have been desperate for any high interest rate. maria: it's a good thing for savers because in your savings account your rates are going to go higher. rachel: really fast because people ask this all the time. when people say this is obama's economy really fast what's your 	answer?

>> what we have to understand  the global war on terror  we are fighting this war on multiple fronts and part of it has to do with psychology. usama bin laden made it very clear that he is waging psychological warfare in the united states of america and guantánamo bay has provided terrorists with a recruitment tool and that is an unfortunate 	thing because when you look at not only guantánamo bay but these other prisons  they produced terrorists we are combating like the leader of isis  he was imprisoned in abu ghraib. we have to look at how we can effectively combat these terrorists and at the same time maintaining our values. >> i couldn't disagree more. as president obama was releasing prisoners from guantánamo  had one in 3 recidivism rate  isis was growing. president obama was getting soft on gitmo to use the phrase there  a new islamic organization was growing and taking over not only minds around the world but huge swaths of land so militant islam will always find a recruiting tool  gitmo is a good length as far as abu ghraib having professional military soldiers their whole job is this facility keeping it secure will prevent a future abu ghraib because you have mps 	trained at this facility. marines killed by a sniper subsequently released by the iraqi government. these worst of the worst in guantánamo bay  those injustices will never happen. jillian: thank you for being here  appreciate your time  we will be right back. full of rich. for 100% conditioning  full of rich. 0% weight. new pantene. foam conditioner. ♪ ♪ . . somehow we always leave 	packing to the last minute. guys  i have a couple of things to wash we got this. even on quick cycle  tide pods cleans great 6x the cleaning power  even in the quick cycle it's got to be tide todd: full-time few for the good  the bad and the ugly. soldier missouri surprising his mom and two brothers.

>> i tell you  when you omit key facts to a document that is a summary of thousands and thousands of documents in itself he omissions can have grave consequences. i think all of us  every american sitting at home right now wants to have full transparency  not partial transparency anymore from anyone in washington and i'm talking republicans and democrats. any politician there are equally 	withholding information from the american public. if you take a document  four page summary i could give you a four page summary of the bible but i can omit john 3:16  god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life  jesus and i'm the way  the truth  the life  and other key  critical  completely deceived you of the truth and the only fact that matters that separates christianity from all the religions that jesus is god. that is dire consequences. doing the same thing with a memo of thousands and thousands of documents and paring it down to four pages can completely be misconstrued and have dire consequences. >> the fbi from what i understand  when they went to take a look at the fbi memo on 	sunday had 30 minutes and there were two or three other fbi members who took a look at it and they came out with this response and as of late last night a report there were changes made. whether those changes were made by republicans or the fbi out of their concern democrats are saying wait a minute  the memo has been changed. here is what devon nunez had to say in response to the statement. saying having stonewalled congress's demand for information for nearly a year no surprise the fbi and doj issue objections to allowing the american people to see information related to surveillance abuses of these agencies  do you think this is just another effort to stonewall? >> no. it is an effort  you pair down something to four pages and omit key facts you can make it say whatever you want to to say. you can do that and i think the fbi is saying when the american public doesn't have the full 	totality of all of the fact if we release a four page memo i'm all for that  let's also release the pfizer application  let's release the woods review file that goes with it that backs every factual assertion in the affidavit. let's release the contents of what the pfizer warrant is gleaning during the investigation  let's see the totality of everything and then the american public  you and me and the second balcony at the state of the union  americans who deserve to hear the truth can know everything. will that happen?
